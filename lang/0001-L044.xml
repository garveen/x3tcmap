 <t id="2011">Solar Power Plant</t>
 <t id="2012">Solar Power plants produce Energy. They are found everywhere in the known universe and are operated and controlled by all races.</t>
 <t id="2013">Energy Cells</t>
 <t id="2014">Energy Cells are the unified energy storage used throughout the whole known universe. The unification of the energy storage specifications allows for interstellar trading with this most basic of all products.</t>
 <t id="2021">Ore Mine</t>
 <t id="2022">Ore mines are mainly built around small asteroids because of the higher productivity that the low gravity of those asteroids allow. Asteroids are first analysed with special scanners for their richness in minerals.(||) Teams of robots who are overseen by miners operate the mines. The Ore is processed and transported to miscellaneous factories where it is used in the making of metal parts.</t>
 <t id="2023">Ore</t>
 <t id="2024">Ore is the most common mineral throughout the whole known universe. It is used in the production process of almost all technical goods. Ore is produced in Ore mines which are build around small asteroids.</t>
 <t id="2031">Silicon Mine</t>
 <t id="2032">Silicon Mines are built around small asteroids which are analysed before for their richness in silicon minerals. The mineral is usually found just below the surface. It is mined by using an open-cast technology where the surface of the asteroid is literally scraped away by great land moving machines, revealing the rich bands of silicon beneath.(||) These are then dug and collected by specialised prospector robots. The Silicon is processed into thin wafers that provide the raw materials for the manufacture of many technical products.</t>

 <t id="2393">Spaceflies</t>
 <t id="2394">This creature is a small unintelligent space fly that lives in the vast emptiness of deep space. They are the size of a small bird and seem to be made out of delicate shinning gossamer that reacts to light and shimmers and shines in a multitude of colours.(||) The Markus live in vast complex hives hollowed out of asteroids and perform a valuable function by collecting space junk and other debris, which they capture and take back to their asteroids to be used in the construction of their hives. They travel together in great swarms and communicate with a series of musical notes, similar to bird song, that echo inside space. Their beauty, and the beauty of their music, is famed throughout the X Universe and all intelligent space races delight in seeing them. Pilots will stop to watch a swarm fly past. Creatures working on the outside of ships and space stations have claimed that the Markus will fly near them and even perch on them, singing all the while. However throughout space sightings of The Markus Space Fly are becoming very rare. This is mainly due to the actions of The Split, who capture and use the small space fly to power their spaceships. Currently the Foundation Guild are pressing for the Markus to be made a protected species and pressure is being put on the Split to change their system of powering their space ship engines. It is believed that, despite a universal ban on their capture or trading, some pirates still hunt and capture this creature in order to sell then to the Split.</t>

 <t id="2823">Wasp Missile</t>
 <t id="2824">The Wasp Class Missile is a very powerful but still light missile. The Wasp missile is the first choice of small fighter craft.(||) It is fast accurate and very deadly. Its lethal reputation has even led it to be fitted to some destroyers. If fired in masses, the high speed makes it nearly impossible for a weapon system, to defend against all incoming missiles.</t>

 <t id="3101">Federal Argon Shipyard</t>
 <t id="3102">{17,3108} {17,3109}</t>
 <t id="3108">(General description for all shipyards)Shipyards are the heart and soul of modern societies. They are factories of gigantic dimension, built to manufacture all the space vehicles and even build and sell whole construction kits for new factories. Because of the immense resources and labour required to build as well as run a factory like this, shipyards are rare to encounter.</t>
 <t id="3109">Argon shipyards are large, automated industrial plants, dedicated to the construction of the entire range of Argon space ships. In addition to the valuable raw materials and technology, these factories also contain experimental areas where new designs and ship improvements are always being developed and tested, and as a result are heavily guarded. Therefore all Argon shipyards should be approached with great caution.</t>
 <t id="3112">The Argon Colossus is the Carrier Class of the Argon. In its working lifespan, this ship has seen many changes. It is heavily armed with 6 cannons and replaces the previous class, which was originally built in response to rumours of a Xenon super ship uncovered by the Argon Secret Service. Because of its success, the Argon built many ships of this new class. As new technologies have been developed, these ships have undergone several major refits in recent jazuras. The flagship of the Argon carrier fleet is the Argon One stationed in Argon Prime.</t>
 <t id="3122">Up to the building of Argon One, the Titan was the biggest ship in the Argon fleet. It is a destroyer class battleship armed with 18 lasers. Although heavy and difficult to manoeuvre, in the hands of a capable Argon Captain, this ship is a powerful weapon with a noble heritage.(||) Its predecessors fought and won many major battles in both the Xenon Conflict and Boron Campaign. Since then the ship has been regularly updated and redesigned, but is still basically the same ship.</t>
 <t id="3142">The Argon Buster was once the pride of the Argon fleet and was instrumental in gaining the Argon victory in the Xenon Conflict. However during the Boron campaign it was superseded by the Argon Elite.(||) Over the intervening jazuras the design of the Argon Buster has been modified and new, more powerful engines have been fitted. Now updated, and armed with two lasers, the Buster is the number two fighter ship of the Argon Fighter Command.</t>
 <t id="3152">The Argon Discoverer compared to other ships in the Argon Fleet, is relatively young. It is armed with two lasers, is light, versatile, and very manoeuvrable.(||) It is the preferred training fighter for Argon pilots with the more experienced being promoted to fly the more exacting Buster and the Nova. Today they are also used for scouting, and it is quite common to find a small wing of these ships accompanying an exploration carrier.</t>
 <t id="3162">The Argon Mammoth is a Heavy Transporter ship, usually found in Argon Federation territory. It is so large that it cannot dock at any space station, instead it is loaded and unloaded by docking some distance from the station, having its freight ferried backwards and forwards by fleets of smaller transporters.(||) These ships are owned by successful private entrepreneur pilots who have made a great investment in order to purchase them - therefore they are more than keen to hire out their services.</t>
 <t id="3181">Free Argon Trading Station</t>
 <t id="3182">Typical Argon Space station used throughout entire Argon federation territory. Developed by Argon over many jazuras these space stations provide the highest standards of both comfort and technology.(||) Each station is fitted with bars, restaurants, casinos, holographic cinemas, and accommodation. They are fine rest and recreation centres. Each space station is under jurisdiction of The Argon Federation and is governed by an elected senator. He represents the station in the main Argon Parliament. Pilots can expect friendly welcome.</t>
 <t id="3191">Argon Equipment Dock</t>
 <t id="3192">Argon Space Equipment Docks are the places in the Argon territory to upgrade space vehicles.</t>
 <t id="3201">Royal Boron Shipyard</t>
 <t id="3202">{17,3108} {17,3209}</t>
 <t id="3209">The Boron shipyard is a hive of activity, mainly due to the fact that the Boron do not believe in a lot of automation, instead preferring to trust the fine skills and talents of their many engineers, craftsmen, and semi skilled workers. Each Boron ship is virtually hand built, and they are rumoured to last longer, be more reliable, and are better made than the ships of many other races.</t>
 <t id="3212">The Boron Shark is a fast carrier class battleship and replaces the much older and outdated Boron Cuttlefish. It is believed that this new ship was designed and constructed in light of the rumours of the Xenon BMS and, together with the Argon One, presents a formidable opposition to any enemy.(||) It is well known that Argon technology was traded with the Boron to enable them to produce such a ship and that the two ships were designed to complement each other.</t>
 <t id="3222">This Boron destroyer is fast, manoeuvrable and, despite the Borons peaceful nature, very deadly. It is heavily armed, and its weapons are complemented with powerful shield generators.(||) Its design and technology was revolutionary, as most of the older Boron designs were scrapped and remade after the Boron Conflict. It is manned by the highly trained pilots of the Boron Space Fleet.</t>
 <t id="3252">The Octopus was developed to be the Boron version of the Discoverer.(||) Its design was revolutionary and all races, when it was first seen, were very keen to know how effective it was. The success of the Octopus sent ripples throughout the Boron sectors as more was produced, but today it is considered to be obsolete, although it is still in service.</t>
 <t id="3262">The Boron Orca is a heavy-duty transporter craft, fractionally bigger than the Argon Mammoth. It cannot dock directly at a space station and has to rely on a relay of smaller ships to ferry cargo backwards and forwards to it.(||) Despite looking cumbersome the Orca is manoeuvrable and is slightly faster than Argon Mammoth. Many of these ships are privately owned and it is possible to hire them - for a price.</t>
 <t id="3272">The Boron Dolphin is a cost effective transporter ship. Its unique Boron technology has been developed and combined with Argon know-how to produce a transporter that can carry great loads whilst moving gracefully.(||) It can be found in most Boron sectors.</t>
 <t id="3281">Royal Boron Trading Station</t>
 <t id="3282">The Space Stations of the Boron are not comfortable due to heavy ammonia content of their atmosphere. Despite that many different races frequently use them as the Boron are not only members of the Foundation Guild but also benefit from established trade agreements with Teladi and Paranid.(||) Each space station is governed by an Imperial Captain selected by the Boron government and whose position is verified by the Boron Royal Family.</t>
 <t id="3291">Boron Equipment Dock</t>
 <t id="3292">Boron Space Equipment Docks are the places in the Boron territory to upgrade space vehicles.</t>
 <t id="3301">Split Shipyard</t>
 <t id="3302">{17,3108} {17,3309}</t>
 <t id="3309">At first the shipyards belonging to the Split seem to look like prison camps. That is not far from the truth as the ruling Split council commit all their criminals to serve time labouring inside the shipyards.(||) The Split shipyards are heavily guarded and it is very rare for a member of any race to get close enough to them to make a full report before getting shot down.</t>
 <t id="3312">The Raptor is the Split carrier ship. It first made an appearance in the war against the Boron when it proved to be effective but vulnerable to attack from beneath. It is believed that, over the intervening jazuras, the Split have re-developed the ship to eliminate this problem.(||) A High-ranking Split officer who is linked by kin to the ruling family clan commands the ship. Generally they are even more abrasive and arrogant than the other members of their race.</t>
 <t id="3322">The Python is the one of the most effective destroyer ships in Split Sectors. It is well armed, and lethal. It is also one of the most aggressive ships in the universe, its captains all being briefed to fire first and ask questions later.(||) There are rumours of a second, more powerful, class of destroyer that was used during a split family feud, but it is thought that these ships no longer exist as the Python is still being produced.</t>
 <t id="3332">A long serving and deadly fighter developed by the Split Military. It has been only in recent jazuras that this ship has been made public.(||) The current Split Patriarch has a small fleet of these ships that act as escort ships that accompany the primary destroyer of the fleet. In the hands of an experienced pilot, this ship can survive the darkest of battles, because of the ships high speed he can avoid most of laser beams and missiles.</t>
 <t id="3342">A forerunner of this ship fought in the Boron Campaign and proved to be a very powerful opponent. Like most of the other split ships, this new design was more based on high speed engines and big weapon power, as in great shield strengths.(||) Over the jazuras this ship had been totally up-dated and rearmed.</t>
 <t id="3362">This huge Transporter is too large to dock in any space station and carries a number of smaller freighters to load and unload its trading goods.(||) It is believed that this Transporter is an evolutionary form of a much smaller Transporter called the Rhino, which seems to have been phased out over the last hundred jazuras. It is believed that a different Split family clan controls each Transporter.</t>
 <t id="3381">Split Trading Port</t>
 <t id="3382">The Split Space Stations are dark and unfriendly places. Visiting trading races are tolerated but not encouraged to stay longer than necessary and are not allowed inside the inner structure.(||) Few members of the Argon race ever venture near enough to them for more detailed information to be compiled. It is believed that many of them are owned by the various ruling family clans.</t>
 <t id="3391">Split Equipment Dock</t>
 <t id="3392">Split Space Equipment Docks are the places in the Split territory to upgrade space vehicles.</t>
 <t id="3401">Paranid Shipyard</t>
 <t id="3402">{17,3108} {17,3409}</t>
 <t id="3409">The Paranid build their spaceships in large automated assembly plants. In these factories they forge their own metals and plastics, design and develop new ships, as well as constructing and testing the entire range of Paranid space ships.</t>
 <t id="3412">The Zeus is the primary carrier in the Paranid Fleet. Information about this ship other than the fact that it as very deadly as result of new weapon technologies, are not released.(||) This ships tactics are not to get close to battle, and to release its swarm of powerful fighters from a distance. Paranid pilots have been known to hide their ships in dense asteroid fields to keep their signature from hostile craft.</t>
 <t id="3422">This destroyer is the pride of the Paranid Fleet. It was developed from an earlier model used by the Paranid in their alliance with the Split in the Boron Campaign.(||) It is believed that this ship was last updated during the threat of conflict between the Paranid and the Split.</t>
 <t id="3452">This ship is the main fighter craft of the Paranid race, and the most common. It has a good speed and is armed with two front mounted laser.(||) Constantly being updated, this ship also dates back to the earlier period of the Paranid Split war against the Boron.</t>
 <t id="3462">This ship is the largest transporter in the Paranid Fleet. It is too big to dock at space stations and employs a fleet of shuttlecraft to load and unload its cargo.(||) It is commanded by a lesser Priest Baron, who is directly under the command of its original space station Priest Duke commander. It is believed that many of these ships can be hired for certain commissions - however those conditions do not apply to members of the Argon race.</t>
 <t id="3472">This ship is the most common of the Paranid transporter ships. It travels great distances, carrying many different goods.(||) Due to the complex hierarchical structure of the Paranid race it is commanded by a lesser Priest Lord under the command of its home space station Priest Duke.</t>
 <t id="3481">Paranid Trading Dock</t>
 <t id="3482">This space station is highly developed and features the latest Paranid technology, however due to their secretive nature, very few people are allowed inside its inner body.(||) Paranid space stations trade mainly with Teladi, Split and Boron. Members of Argon race are allowed to trade but, due to the ongoing animosity between the two races, trade is the only contact the two races have. A Priest Duke commands each space station. It is however believed that each station contains a Paranid temple, access as usual is strictly restricted to Paranid Monks.</t>
 <t id="3491">Paranid Equipment Dock</t>
 <t id="3492">Paranid Space Equipment Docks are the places in the Paranid territory to upgrade space vehicles.</t>
 <t id="3501">Teladi Shipyard</t>
 <t id="3502">{17,3108} {17,3509}</t>
 <t id="3509">The shipyards of the Teladi could never be described as hi-tech. Indeed these large factories are packed with a strange assortment of low-tech equipment supplied by many different races, and cobbled together to create a makeshift work area.(||) Long ago the Teladi, ever aware of the need to make profit, decided the most economic way to build space craft was to get someone else to do it for them. They buy ships from other races that are either old, damaged, or just past their sell-by-date which they dismantle, and cannibalise, using the parts and equipment to make ships better suited to their own requirements.</t>
 <t id="3512">The Condor is the carrier ship of the Teladi Company Space Fleet. It is a powerful battleship based upon technology supplied by the Split combined with that of the older Argon Prime VI.(||) Rarely seen outside Teladi sectors the ship is slow but heavily armed and shielded compared to the carriers of other races, its Captains preferring to last longer than others in a battle while still avoiding to get into trouble in the first place.</t>
 <t id="3522">The Phoenix is the destroyer ship operated by the Teladi Company Space Fleet. Its technology is based upon the Paranid Odysseus and the Boron Ray. It is well armed and shielded but rarely known to fight.</t>
 <t id="3532">The Teladi Falcon fighter is a hybrid between the old Argon Elite and the Boron Piranha, with some Split technology thrown in for good measure. It is fast, well armed and can be found operating in most sectors.(||) It is suspected that some of these ships have been leased by the Teladi Company Space Fleet to operate on behalf of the pirates, although to date no actual proof of this agreement can be established.</t>
 <t id="3562">This huge transporter is too large for any space station and carries its own fleet of smaller transporter ships which load and unload its cargo.(||) It is one of the best shielded large transporter ships, a testimony to the Teladi trait of preferring to last long enough until help arrives. Its basic design and technology is a hybrid between an older version of the Argon Mammoth and the Paranid Hercules.</t>
 <t id="3572">The Vulture is the trading vessel commonly used by the Teladi in all space sectors and can always be found wherever the largest profit is to be made, no matter in whose sector it happens to be.(||) It is also believed that a number of these transporters have been supplied to the Pirates that operate throughout Teladi sectors in exchange for unknown preferential trading services.</t>
 <t id="3581">Teladi Trading Station</t>
 <t id="3582">Teladi space stations are basically functional but not built for comfort, they are solely built for trading purposes.(||) They are not popular places due to the Teladi belief in profit. On each space station everything has a price, and one that is generally higher than other races. Much of the hi-tech equipment on board the station has been bought or traded from other races and so the station inside appears to be a strange hybrid mixture of the various race technologies. Each station is controlled by a citizen who sits on the Teladi governing board.</t>
 <t id="3591">Teladi Space Equipment Dock</t>
 <t id="3592">Teladi Space Equipment Docks are basically functional but not built for comfort, they are solely built to upgrade space vehicles.</t>
 <t id="3612">The Carrier ship of the Xenon is a slow yet powerful beast. Armed with Several cannons and fighters stored in its large hangar bay, the Xenon J is considered a moderate threat.(||) Most ships are able to escape an attack from a J class ship because of its speed. But these ships are usually accompanied by several Destroyer vessels.</t>
 <t id="3622">This destroyer was one of the most powerful ships the Argon faced in the Xenon Conflict and its memory still deserves the greatest of respect.(||) It had formidable firepower and a great defensive capability. The Xenon in the last decade have updated this class of ship. This ship should still be considered as a major threat, although they hardly ever leave their own systems.</t>
 <t id="3632">The L is the most powerful Xenon fighter developed; it is armed with multiple lasers, and powerful shields.(||) These ships are often seen attacking passing ships trying to take shortcuts through their sectors. Like the other Xenon ships, the L has been updated in the last few jazuras.</t>
 <t id="3642">The Xenon M is a fighter craft that first fought in the Xenon Conflict. It was fast and lethal.(||) Its pilots showed no sign of fear. Indeed many of these ships were used as kamikaze craft, deliberately being crashed into Argon carriers and destroyers.</t>
 <t id="3652">The N is considered to be a short-range scout ship of the Xenon, it is only lightly armed but very fast.(||) A forerunner of this ship fought in the Xenon conflict, but its participation was not considered to be great.</t>
 <t id="3662">The Xenon I is the largest freighter used by the Xenon to set up their stations.(||) Like its smaller counterpart, this ship is rarely seen, but it has been known to replace stations destroyed by Attackers. It also is usually accompanied by a group of fighters and sometimes a Xenon K.</t>
 <t id="3671">Xenon H</t>
 <t id="3672">The Xenon H is the smaller freighter used by the Xenon, this ship has not changed much and is very rare to see.(||) Several fighters usually accompany it. But be warned, as this freighter is capable of carrying heavy weaponry.</t>
 <t id="3681">Xenon Shipyard</t>
 <t id="3682">Shipyards are the heart and soul of modern societies. And all the sentient races have at least one. The Xenon shipyard is of different construct to the other races, and not much is known about it.(||) What is known is that all the Xenon ships are constructed here, from the basic Xenon N to the large Xenon J Carrier ships. And it is also believed that the Xenon Mothership was also constructed here. Like most Xenon installations, it is heavily guarded by a destroyer group. Which is why this station hasn't been destroyed to prevent Xenon attacks.</t>
 <t id="3691">Xenon Station</t>
 <t id="3692">This station has been in use since the Xenon Conflict, it is a simple construct of modules that rotates to generate gravity by using pulses of rotational thrusters.(||) It is unclear what happens on Xenon Bases, but these stations are located in most Xenon Sectors. What is clear is that these stations house many ships, from fighters to freighters and are heavily guarded. Approach with caution.</t>
 <t id="3699">The illustrations used are developed from what little knowledge exists to the Argon Secret Service combined with some expert guess work based upon experience gained during the Xenon Conflict. It could well be that many of the Xenon ships have changed shape or that their designs have been updated. It has been assumed that their technology has advanced over the years in a similar way to the other races of the Universe.</t>

Unlike Planets they have almost no gravitational field making it easy to explore their minerals with modern machinery.(||) Almost all the silicon and ore is nowadays produced in space mines build on top of Asteroids. Some Asteroids have higher amounts of resources than others.</t>
 <t id="3731">Gate</t>
 <t id="3732">Space gates are believed to be remains of a superior ancient alien life form. Scientists of all races have failed to understand how they function. They form a web connecting the different systems and allowed all the races to leave their home systems once they had achieved local space flight and found the gates.</t>

 <t id="3742">A religious installation run by a sect that calls itself the Goners.</t>
 <t id="3761">Pirate Anarchy Port</t>
 <t id="3762">A pirate base with a difference, this station is much larger and more heavily protected than a standard pirate base, any ship that approaches it is automatically scanned for concealed weapons to ensure they are not carrying police or enemy fighters.(||) Unlike its counterpart this station is built using a captured base that existed in this sector before it was seized by a pirate force. This stations trade port and cargo facilities are large, and stocks everything from shields and high-tech weaponry, though to Space weed and Cahoona Meatsteaks. Due to the illegal operations carried out by the pirates this station also acts as their main area of rest and recreation. All manner of pleasures are to be found inside - most of them either highly immoral or highly illegal.</t>
 <t id="3771">Pirate Ship</t>
 <t id="3772">The Pirates often use transporters supplied by the Teladi, but they also use a wide variety of transporter ships that have been captured, stolen or in some cases traded from most races. All of them are armed.(||) These ships are very difficult to spot being heavily camouflaged. They tend to slip through space without being noticed. Even if they are seen they are very difficult to approach as most of them are engaged in highly illegal operations.</t>
 <t id="3781">Pirate Base</t>
 <t id="3782">Despite the pirates calling their base a space station this pirate base is actually constructed from the hulks of old transporter ships. It is heavily camouflaged and is very difficult to locate and see.(||) It is also rumoured that if the base is in danger of attack, or discovery, it is simply flown to a new secret location. It is also well guarded and any ship that approaches it is automatically scanned for concealed weapons, and to ensure they are not carrying police or enemy fighters. Once accepted at the station a pilot may trade anything and everything. No cargo is too dangerous, no price is too high for the right goods. Due to the illegal operations carried out by the pirates this station also acts as their main area of rest and recreation. All manner of pleasures are to be found inside - most of them either highly immoral or highly illegal.</t>
 <t id="3791">Data Storage Device</t>
 <t id="3792">This is a data storage device. It can store audio and video data.</t>
 <t id="3812">This ship is considered to be a valuable asset to the pirates, as they cannot buy ships from any of the races, except ships supplied by the Teladi. It can use a variety of weapons and missiles.(||) It can usually defend itself against similar opponents, and has a fair amount of cargo space. Most of the time it is escorted by Pirate Bayamons and Pirate Mandalays.</t>
 <t id="3822">This fast and powerful ship offers the most versatility for pirates. It is among the fastest ships in its class of all known races. Its speed, mobility and the 4 weapon mounts make this ship deadly, its effectiveness should never be underestimated.</t>
 <t id="3832">The Pirate Mandalay is the fastest of the Pirate ships. The Mandalay is the backbone for express transfers of cargo and also as an auxiliary escort to the Orinoco in conjunction with the Bayamon.</t>

 <t id="3904">This upgrade can help you find the location inside your current sector where you can sell each of your trading items for the highest price.(||) Very usefully for advanced traders!</t>
 <t id="3911">SQUASH Mine Factory</t>
 <t id="3912">This factory produces the SQUASH mine, a small explosive device developed to blockade stations, trading routes and gates.(||) Although these devices can be handy to use against military targets, they are considered highly illegal by some races who have witnessed some of these weapons accidentally destroy merchant and civilian ships as they do not have friend or foe recognition.</t>
 <t id="3913">SQUASH Mine</t>
 <t id="3914">A very destructive mine. Typically used to protect important strategic locations. Beware: This mine does not have a friend foe recognition!</t>
 <t id="3921">Lasertower Factory</t>
 <t id="3922">This factory produces laser towers, developed to become the ultimate defence for all stations. With a powerful laser that only fits into laser towers these weapons are considered to be substantially advanced in comparison to previous forms of weaponry.(||) Laser towers have started to appear in all corners of known space as all races see just how useful these defences can be against small groups of raiders. The artificial intelligence on board these towers allow for them to identify when the station it is protecting comes under attack, it can then adjust its friend or foe system accordingly.</t>
 <t id="3923">Lasertower</t>
 <t id="3924">A defence installation typically found around stations or factories to help them against invaders.</t>
 <t id="3931">Drone Factory</t>
 <t id="3932">This production facility manufactures the fighter drone, a small autonomous device that when given orders will attack using its single laser weapon.(||) They are produced using the best in computer technology, artificial intelligence and laser weaponry. Pilots use these small drones not to cause considerable damage to an enemy ship, but to cause numerous distractions when being attacked. If used in numbers, fighter drones can be effective.</t>
 <t id="3933">Fighter Drone</t>
 <t id="3934">A fighting drone can be launched against an enemy ship and attacks the target autonomously.</t>
 <t id="3943">Cargo Lifesupport System</t>
 <t id="3944">This life-support system allows you to transport living creatures, passengers and even slaves in your cargo bay.</t>
 <t id="3953">Boost Extension</t>
 <t id="3954">This boost extension allows your ship to accelerate with three times its normal acceleration. This extension is essential in some combat situations.</t>
 <t id="3963">Strafe Drive Extension</t>
 <t id="3964">This extension allows a ship to steer sideways without turning, making some advanced steering manoeuvres possible.</t>
 <t id="3973">Transporter Device</t>
 <t id="3974">The transporter device is a development based on the remains of the jump drive, first introduced with the Xperimental ship and reverse engineered by the best scientists of all races. Using this device you can move from one ship into another within a range of 5km without using your spacesuit.</t>
 <t id="3983">Jumpdrive</t>
 <t id="3984">The jump drive is a new development. This ultimate upgrade allows your ship to jump to far distant sectors immediately. To focus on a distant jump gate through many different sectors and through many other gates, it requires additional energy containers for every sector it has to cross.</t>
 <t id="3993">Best Buys Locator</t>

 <t id="4012">When the first system was attacked this was one of the two heavy ships observed. It is armed with 6 weapons that are visible. There have been reports of smaller class ships docking to this ship. Its function would lead us to believe that it is equivalent with a Carrier class ship, but nothing else is known at present.(||) Upon a close scan, it appeared to have a large cargo bay.</t>
 <t id="4022">This ship is extremely dangerous. Keeping your distance would be advised. A scout recorded a count of at least 18 weapons, 3 mounted on 6 turrets. It has not been confirmed yet if this is true. This ship also was present at the first encounter of which single-handedly destroyed two stations. It is approximately the equivalent of a Destroyer class ship.</t>
 <t id="4032">This ship first appeared in an assault party. It is the heaviest fighter class ship of this race. It is speculated that it is equivalent to an M3 class.(||) No pilots have yet survived to relay more information from a battlefield. It is rumoured that some ships though have been captured and are being investigated to extract alien technology</t>
 <t id="4042">This ship was first seen on a skirmish that took place recently. It is equivalent to an M4 class ship.(||) Shields and weaponry are unknown. The tactics used suggest that its flying seems to be co-ordinated instead of being flown individually.</t>
 <t id="4052">This ship was the first that was encountered of this species. It is considered to be a Scout ship due to its speed and armament.(||) It is very agile and its flying observed in a group formation suggests that they are some type of insectoid or based on a Hive like behaviour and being controlled from one point. This theory has yet to be verified due to limited contact. Not much else is known about this ship</t>
 <t id="4062">This ship first appeared in an assault party. The ship is made up of an M3 Fighter and several smaller M5 Scout craft.(||) One theory is that the gateless jump drive this species operates needs multiple power generators to form a stable wormhole that allows for the jump into known territories, where they then split to form a wing of fighters. The tactics used suggest that its flying seems to be co-ordinated instead of being flown individually.</t>
 <t id="4082">The function of this alien station is not yet determined.(||) Even when scanned at close range by a cover operation, revealed inconsistent data and interference. Even under further analysis, nothing was able to be determined about its function.</t>
 <t id="4112">The Centaur is a new development from Argon Shipwrights in Omicron Lyrae, the ship itself is larger than a Fighter or Small Transporter, but is much smaller than a Destroyer.(||) Centaur is a new breed of corvette Class craft, capable of carrying one M5 class ship. Armed with turrets capable of supporting heavy weaponry, faster than a Nova and with over 3 times the shield strength, this ship has a bright future ahead of it.</t>
 <t id="4132">When the long serving Argon Elite was retired four jazuras ago, the Argon military was left without an M3 fighter, that was until a group of Shipwrights in Omicron Lyrae put forward plans for a new type of ship. The Nova was born shortly afterwards, and after two jazuras of testing virtually all of the older Elite class ship have been replaced by this new craft.(||) Capable of holding powerful weaponry, and armed with an aft turret, the Nova is bound to serve the Argon military for many jazuras to come.</t>
 <t id="4162">The purpose of the Express is to act as a passenger transporter for civilians wanting to travel between systems and stations.(||) This was always a problem as passengers travelled in converted Lifter class freighters. But when the lifter was retired from service, it was found the Mercury could not replace the job of transporting people. The Express was constructed by a group of Civilians at Argon Prime out of old planetary transport hulls to transport its workers from one station to another in one go. The Argon Shipyard saw the ship and became interested in its design, which was altered slightly to act as the newest passenger transport ship.</t>
 <t id="4172">Mercury is the latest addition to the Argon Merchant Fleet, and it is a worthy successor to the Argon Lifter. Armed with an aft turret for defensive purposes, and increased shield space, the Mercury is more than capable of defending itself.(||) Argon shipwrights that developed this craft were more than proud when the first ship rolled off the production line at Argon Prime.</t>
 <t id="4181">Federal Argon Wharf</t>
 <t id="4182">Shipyards are the heart and soul of modern societies. The older version of the shipyards were brought back into service when the Argon Shipyards became overworked building more, larger ships and new station classes. Wharfs are built to handle the construction of smaller ships, freighters, and corvettes.(||) It is also known that the Argon Wharf is a hub of research and trade activity, when ships of other races are sold here, they are dismantled and researched, or sold back to the race to whom they belong. All Argon Wharfs are heavily guarded by Argon fighter patrols.</t>
 <t id="4212">The Boron Hydra is a new class of ship, corvettes were developed to give extra protection to large fleets of Transport craft, and to destroy any incoming missiles while the fighters dealt with the attacking vessels, a job that they still keep to this day as they are fast enough to keep up with a convoy.(||) It is also capable of holding one M5 class ship that can be used for various tasks.</t>
 <t id="4232">The Barracuda is a new development to replace the Eel. When the plans for the Barracuda were developed, it was made clear that the Eel was too out-dated. The Barracuda improved on the design with a new power generator. This then allowed for the weaponry to be upgraded and room for slightly increased cargo space and improved acceleration.(||) As the Barracuda is now in service the Eel is no longer supported by the Boron Navy.</t>
 <t id="4242">A Major design flaw in the Piranha, lead to it being decommissioned from service. After being left without a light fighter class, the Boron Navy commissioned the Mako, it has enlarged cargo space and speed when compared to the Piranha, but has similar weapon capacities.(||) The design is loosely based on that of the Barracuda, as it is the same team of designers who constructed both ships.</t>
 <t id="4262">The Manta used to be used for royal service only, transporting important personnel from one sector to another. But now the ship has been downgraded to carry Passengers between systems.(||) The ship itself is large enough to carry many people, equipped with state of the art entertainment systems and comfortable seating to give the passengers a safe journey. It is also able to carry a certain amount to laser weaponry for defence.</t>
 <t id="4281">Royal Boron Dry-dock</t>
 <t id="4282">Shipyards are the heart and soul of modern societies, and the Boron dry-dock does not stray from this simple description. They build smaller craft so that the larger shipyards can handle the building of Stations and larger battleships and transporters.(||) Most smaller Boron Ships are born here when the local research and development team test their ships. Boron high standards mean that only 1 in 30 ships designed, are put into full service. Each Boron ship is virtually hand built, they are rumoured to last longer, be more reliable, and are better made than the ships of many other races.</t>
 <t id="4312">The Dragon is the new designed Corvette class ship of the split, which had some problems during the test phase of the prototype. It is a very fast ship, with great weapon power.(||)The Dragon entered service a decade ago, only to be taken out again when the prototype ship exploded as it docked to a shipyard in Family Pride, destroying the structure and killing 500 people who were on board at the time. The Split spent a further 3 jazuras trying to find out why the ship exploded. A small fracture in the reactor was to blame, and when the reactor casing was re-designed the ship re-entered service, although many split pilots consider the ship a curse.</t>
 <t id="4352">This ship is the successful replacement to the ageing Wolf that was in service since the Split first started to construct ships. The Jaguar is capable of increased speed and increased firepower at the expense of cargo space.(||) This ship is primarily used as a scout craft, due to its speed, mainly as it is unable to do anything more.</t>
 <t id="4362">This fast transport ship has been in service for many jazuras now. The ship was originally intended to be a Slave transport craft, which transported slaves from where they were captured to the factories where they would spend the rest of their tazuras.(||) Now the ship is used to transport personnel from sector to sector. It is armed with adequate weaponry, but its main defence is speed.</t>
 <t id="4372">The prototype replacement to the Mule, was nearly destroyed in the Dragon Incident, but it managed to save 100 people that were nearly killed as the docking crew tried to escape. The Caiman Project was continued in Cho's Defeat where it was eventually finished, and put into service taking supplies to rebuild the Shipyard in Family Pride.(||) The ship is armed with a single turret and slightly faster than its predecessor.</t>
 <t id="4381">Split Dockyard</t>
 <t id="4382">An original Paranid Hard Labour Camp, designed to hold prisoners and to force them to build small craft for the Paranid Empire. This was to change when the Paranid built large Shipyards. After the Dragon Incident, it was decided to bring back these smaller independent shipyards for constructing smaller craft, where they could be tested and modified.(||) If an accident does occur again, the Split will have a separate station to fall on when they need to rebuild. You can usually find small craft, transporters and corvettes here, but not all ships can be found at every Dockyard.</t>
 <t id="4412">The Nemesis is the newest battleship to enter the Paranid Army; the ship is a small craft with the firepower of near to the level of a Carrier. Its defence consists of 2 Shield Slots, and capable of carrying Hornet Missiles. Its speed is to the equivalent of Fighters, which makes it capable of acting as a Bomber or as an Escort Ship.(||) It is capable of carrying one M5 craft, which can act as a transport or backup craft, as the nemesis cannot dock with most stations.</t>
 <t id="4442">The Pericles was developed to replace the aging Poseidon. The Pericles improved on the earlier model by increasing shield capacity and the speed of the ship, while keeping the weapon compatibility.(||) The Pericles spent a long time in development as it had some structural flaws. These flaws were ironed out and the ship entered service to the sadness of the pilots who had become used to the sight of the Poseidon.</t>
 <t id="4462">The Hermes is based on an old original design for the Ganymede, but the design was re-worked to accommodate passengers. Like most Paranid ships it is able to hold a certain amount of weaponry, primarily for defence.(||) It is very unlikely you will see this ship in Argon Systems, mainly as the tension between the two neighbours remains high.</t>
 <t id="4472">The Demeter has been used for some jazuras now, replacing the old Paranid Ganymede model, improving on all of its predecessors systems.(||) This ship was first brought into service to serve only the Paranid Fleet, but later slowly replaced the Ganymede because of their speed to bring the Paranid Economy back to levels of the Argon and Boron.</t>
 <t id="4481">Paranid Pier</t>
 <t id="4482">The Paranid Pier is a small station built separate to a larger shipyard, unlike most other races these stations do not build the craft, but add the components to them before being sold, this is due to the construction process by the Paranid, the hulls of ships are built at the main shipyard then transported to the Pier where the rest of the ship is built.(||) This was done when docking at the original shipyards had a maximum of 6 stazuras wait to dock. This meant Paranid expansion into new territories took a long time. The Pier was designed and built within three mazuras from a spare equipment dock to handle the traffic of traders.</t>
 <t id="4512">The Osprey is a muddle of Argon and original Teladi Technology, it was developed to become a long-range cargo transport craft, as it fits similar amounts of cargo to the Teladi Vulture.(||) The ship itself combines Shield and Weapon Compatibility to be one of the most deadly Teladi Craft currently in service. But its speed makes it one of the slowest craft of its class.</t>
 <t id="4542">The Buzzard was developed to replace the Teladi's most successful fighter; the Hawk. The Buzzard improves on virtually every aspect of its predecessor. The main feature of the ship is the third shield slot and much improved acceleration.(||) Although the Hawk was the pride of the Teladi Fighter Fleet, the Buzzard may just surpass its good reputation.</t>
 <t id="4552">The Teladi Bat was considered to be the slowest M5 of its class, so it was retired and the Teladi Harrier replaced the ship. It is considered to be more profitable out of the two, although it has not improved on its speed very much.(||) As the Teladi Believe in profit the ships cargo bay has been extended to fit double the original capacity at the expense of shield space.</t>
 <t id="4562">The Toucan is a mid-range luxury passenger transport craft. Equipped with the necessary entertainment facilities to keep its passengers comfortable in its journey, from computerised gambling to up to the date visual entertainment, all in the confines of a luxury seat.(||) The ship itself can be armed, but lacks speed; it is known that this ship is the slowest of its class.</t>
 <t id="4581">Teladi Showroom</t>
 <t id="4582">The Teladi Showroom is exactly what it sounds like; small ships are transported here to be sold in luxurious surroundings.(||) Unlike other Teladi stations, Showrooms allow the buyer to view a ship before purchase; this was done when it was found that Teladi Ship Sales are only at 8% when all races sales are put together. After the Teladi opened up on their ships, the sales jumped higher. These stations were first placed in key Teladi Sectors, but soon expanded to other primary sectors. But buyers beware; the Teladi will try everything to get your money.</t>
 <t id="4621">Ion Disruptor Forge</t>
 <t id="4622">This forge manufactures the weapon known as the Ion Disruptor. This new weapon is considered to be more useful than powerful.(||) Manufacturing the weapon is a different matter, it is a complicated process, which involves creating a device able to create a stream of ionised particles. This itself is dangerous.</t>
 <t id="4623">Ion Disruptor</t>
 <t id="4624">This weapon is unlike any weapon encountered, developed by Boron Scientists, this weapon fires a steady stream of ion particles in the direction of a ship. Then the stream is ignited. The result is a lightning effect that affects ship systems and shields, while leaving the hull relatively untouched.(||) Although this weapon is new, it has undergone extensive testing to make sure it keeps up to Boron standards.</t>
 <t id="4631">Mobile Drilling System Factory</t>
 <t id="4632">This factory manufactures the Mobile Drilling System which is used to break up ore-rich asteroids into smaller pieces without the need for a stationary mining facility.</t>
 <t id="4633">Mobile Drilling System</t>
 <t id="4634">The Mobile Drilling System accelerates and emits small fast rotating helical particles which drill into rock and use supersonic resonance to break up the rock. Its effectiveness against other materials is very low.</t>

 <t id="4671">Alpha PSG Forge</t>
 <t id="4672">This forge manufactures the Alpha PSG weapon, a new breakthrough in weaponry technology.(||) The process of building this weapon is a complicated one that requires job specific machinery. Safety is also an issue, the prototype station exploded when the main matter compressor overloaded. Since the incident, the manufacturing process has changed.</t>
 <t id="4673">Alpha Phased Shockwave Generator</t>
 <t id="4674">This weapon was developed in conjunction between the Teladi and Paranid. It works by sending out a phased package, which reacts and expands, creating a shockwave of phased energy.(||) This weapon has many uses, many of which can be quite useful, one is missile defence.</t>
 <t id="4681">Beta PSG Forge</t>
 <t id="4682">This forge manufactures the Beta PSG weapon, a new breakthrough in weaponry technology.(||) The process of building this weapon is a complicated one that requires job specific machinery. Safety is also an issue, the prototype station exploded when the main matter compressor overloaded. Since the incident, the manufacturing process has changed.</t>
 <t id="4683">Beta Phased Shockwave Generator</t>
 <t id="4684">This weapon is the Mark Two version of the PSG Weapon. It works by sending out a phased package, which reacts and expands, creating a shockwave of enhanced phased energy.(||) This weapon has many uses, many of which can be quite useful, one is missile defence.</t>
 <t id="4691">Gamma PSG Forge</t>
 <t id="4692">This forge manufactures the Gamma PSG weapon, a new breakthrough in weaponry technology.(||) The process of building this weapon is a complicated one that requires job specific machinery. Safety is also an issue, the prototype station exploded when the main matter compressor overloaded. Since the incident, the manufacturing process has changed.</t>
 <t id="4693">Gamma Phased Shockwave Generator</t>
 <t id="4694">This weapon is the Mark Three version of the PSG Weapon. It works by sending out a phased package, which reacts and expands, creating a shockwave of enhanced phased energy.(||) This weapon has many uses, many of which can be quite useful, one is multiple fighter defence.</t>
 <t id="4731">Xperimental Shuttle</t>
 <t id="4732">Not much is known about the ship known as the Xperimental Shuttle. This ship was supposed to be able to cross vast distances without having to use jump gates, by generating its own wormhole. Argon Scientists are still trying to fix the ship and get its drive back into working order.(||) When the ship was built it was considered to be the fastest ship of its class. It also attracted the attention of people when it landed on stations, as this ship is unique.</t>
 <t id="4741">Space Suit</t>
 <t id="4742">This technologically advanced space suit keeps the wearer warm, shields from radiation and offers some manoeuvrability, but gives little protection against laser weapons.</t>
 <t id="4752">The Goner ship is the only ship known to be in use by the Goners. Due to the peaceful nature of the goners this ship holds no weaponry. The ship is quite fast and is also considered to be a good short-range freighter due to its cargo space. It is also capable of holding shields compatible with some M3 fighters.(||) You will probably see this ship roaming the sectors spreading the word of the Goners and R.Gunne.</t>
 <t id="4761">Advanced Satellite</t>
 <t id="4762">{17,4814}</t>
 <t id="4771">Camera Drone</t>
 <t id="4772">{17,4804}</t>
 <t id="4803">Camera Drone</t>
 <t id="4804">New on the public market, developed by the Argon military to receive accurate tactical information on its neighbours. The Camera Drone has been updated over the last decade to incorporate the newest in video capture technology to feed live information to the person who remotely controls the device.(||) Today the device is used to survey new sectors and planets, as well as spying on neighbours and monitoring enemy activities.</t>
 <t id="4811">Advanced Satellite Factory</t>
 <t id="4812">This stations manufactures Advanced Satellites. Additionally to the common Navigation Relay Satellite Advanced Satellites feature video capture technology. The factory uses delicate machinery to build these complicated small devices.(||) With the invention of sending information through the gate network, satellites were developed to assist in boosting these transmissions, scientists later added a small sensor network to the satellites to assist in navigation and long range managing of stations.</t>
 <t id="4813">Advanced Satellite</t>
 <t id="4814">This satellite is the next generation of advanced communications. It is capable of video capture technology, a new feature that was developed to keep an eye on stations and ships.(||) This satellite still has the old features that allow for navigation and information relay transfer.</t>
 <t id="4823">Ore Collector</t>
 <t id="4824">After Ore has been broken up by a mobile drilling system, the smaller rocks can be brought into the cargo bay using this new device. It works by targeting the smaller rocks with a low powered gravity beam, bringing the ore into the bay ready to be sold.</t>
 <t id="4833">Camouflage Device</t>
 <t id="4834">This is a specialised device originally developed for spy missions by the Paranid, the technology behind the device is unknown. It renders the ship invisible to gravidar and to sight. Because of its dangerous nature it is now considered highly illegal in most sectors as there are fears that if the device falls into either Pirate or Xenon hands, any of the sentient races would be at risk to attack.(||) Although there are rumours that each race military has a covert operations squadron equipped these devices.</t>
 <t id="4863">Spacefly Collector</t>
 <t id="4864">Although Spacefly collecting is illegal, the flies have become the most costly commodity in the universe. These small creatures are lured by the high-resonance wave of the device, into the ship's hold.(||) These spaceflies are then sold to anyone who will take them, automatically making a profit. This activity is illegal but within pirate communities it has become a way of life.</t>
 <t id="4871">Alpha PPC Forge</t>
 <t id="4872">Originally a Weapons Research Laboratory for argon scientists, now home to the production of the Photon Pulse Cannon. A powerful weapon for capital ships.</t>
 <t id="4873">Alpha Photon Pulse Cannon</t>
 <t id="4874">First developed by Professor Jo Bydnah of the Argon, the Photon Pulse Cannon became a favourite of the argon Military, who then sold the original designs on to the other races. This type of weapon is extremely powerful, and can only be fitted on the larger Capital craft.(||) It works by sending highly charged photon radiation through a series of coils, that multiplies the charge, creating a very deadly pulse of radiation.</t>
 <t id="4881">Beta PPC Forge</t>
 <t id="4882">An upgraded PPC Forge, the Beta Version is more powerful with a longer construction process. The PPC is a powerful weapon for capital ships.</t>
 <t id="4883">Beta Photon Pulse Cannon</t>
 <t id="4884">The next version of the PPC series first developed by Professor Jo Bydnah of the Argon. This type of weapon is extremely powerful, and can only be fitted on the larger Capital craft.(||) It works by sending highly charged photon radiation through a series of coils, that multiplies the charge, creating a very deadly pulse of radiation, this version also includes a super conducting coil set.</t>
 <t id="4891">Gamma PPC Forge</t>
 <t id="4892">The Most powerful PPC weapon is constructed here. A fully upgraded Forge with autonomous machinery to construct the most deadly Capital Weapon to Date.</t>
 <t id="4893">Gamma Photon Pulse Cannon</t>
 <t id="4894">The most powerful version of the PPC series first developed by Professor Jo Bydnah. This type of weapon is extremely powerful, and can only be fitted on the larger Capital craft.(||) It works by sending highly charged photon radiation through a series of coils, which multiplies the charge, creating a very deadly pulse of radiation. A proton filter makes the weapon more effective against hull and shields, allowing the weapon to react with the hull.</t>
 <t id="4903">Sting</t>
 <t id="4913">Needle</t>
 <t id="4923">Thorn</t>
 <t id="4932">The Perseus is the successor to the Prometheus. Its first test run was considered an embarrassment to the Paranid as it was stolen by a Pirate, leading to their request for external help to recover it.(||) The ship was initially tested with shields used for corvette ships but they wrecked havoc with some of the internal systems so they were changed for above standard sizes.</t>
 <t id="4941">Lasertower Weapon Forge</t>
 <t id="4942">This factory produces the lasertower weapon. This weapon is incompatible with all ships. It can only be used in the lasertower defence platform.(||) The station uses high tech machinery to assemble this weapon, it is a very dangerous process which uses plasma energy.</t>
 <t id="4943">Lasertower Weapon</t>
 <t id="4944">This is the primary high-energy plasma beam that is used in Lasertowers. Its main energy systems make this weapon incompatible with large ships for the time being(||), although scientists are trying to find a way to remedy this situation.(||) Argon scientists first developed this weapon by accident when using a photon enhanced Gamma radiation, which created a beam laser.</t>
 <t id="4951">Mass Driver Forge</t>
 <t id="4952">Mass Drivers are a new invention by the Argon and Split. It makes use of the magnetic firing system that allows the projectile to be fired out at rapid speed without the need for chemical or laser based firing systems. Projectiles are bought separately and are sold in Ammunition Crates.</t>
 <t id="4953">Mass Driver</t>
 <t id="4954">This weapon is unique in that it is the only type of non-energy based projectile weapon available. It consists of a rapid feed multi barrelled cannon, which is capable of delivering a large number of small projectiles to its target in a short period of time.(||) It inflicts damage not due power of individual projectiles but because of the large numbers of projectiles delivered. Due to the unique nature of this weapon's ammunition it has almost no effect on a ship's shields but instead delivers heavy damage directly to the target's hull. It also causes very little power drain due to the fact that its ammunition supplies all energy requirements. Currently the weapon can only be fitted to Argon and split ships as they are the only ships that can accommodate the ammunition feed system. The true power of this weapon comes from its ammunition.</t>
 <t id="4961">Ammunition Factory</t>
 <t id="4962">This factory is devoted to the creation and distribution of Ammunition for the Mass Driver weapon.(||) Projectiles are created for hardened steel, which is produced on the station. Each projectile is then put into feed crates that are sold and are placed directly into the Mass Driver weapon system.</t>
 <t id="4963">Mass Driver Ammunition</t>
 <t id="4964">This is special ammunition for use in the Mass Driver. Each projectile is a self contained unit consisting of the projectile itself and a small armour piercing shell which is then encased in a unique crystalline matrix, which allows the shells to pass through ship shields unhindered, by producing a tiny spatial distortion using the shields own energy. This pack contains 200 rounds.</t>
 <t id="4971">TerraCorp Headquarters</t>
 <t id="4972">This is the most important station belonging to the TerraCorp Company based in Home of Light. Parts of this facility are open to the public, although most of the station is closed to personnel only. These include research facilities and company offices. A range of technology can be found here, and some rare devices that are only offered by one particular race. Materials are often required and are bought by the TerraCorp Company for a fair price.(||) A small fleet of ships can usually be found nearby making the station highly guarded. The station also incorporates state of the art recreation and commerce facilities, including Hotels, Sport Domes, Cinemas and Restaurants. Most races are welcome here to trade.</t>

 <t id="5051">Navigational Beacon</t>
 <t id="5052">Hazard Warning Beacons are placed by civilian militias to mark out the trade routes in dangerous sectors, they emit pulses of light that show the trade lanes between gates and stations.(||) By flying close to these beacons you can be assured of a safe flight, although pirates sometimes use these trade routes as target practice.</t>
 <t id="5061">Federal Argon Installation</t>
 <t id="5062">This installation can be found across Argon Territory near to zones of war, or the edges of their territory. It is heavily guarded with several squadrons of fighters and military transport craft. Access can be granted to some traders so they can upgrade their ships or even join the Federal Argon Police Militias.(||) Built using the same design station as the Argon trade docks, the installations interior however does not resemble these popular stations. They have military testing ranges and fighter research facilities.</t>
 <t id="5071">Royal Boron Research Station</t>
 <t id="5072">This design of station is credited with coming across great finds. The facility researches anything from weapons and ships to archaeology and medical equipment.(||) It can usually be found in orbit of planets with a high scientific interest. With several squadrons of the best boron fighters, this station is heavily guarded. Traders can come to this station to bring food and supplies to this station.</t>
 <t id="5081">Paranid Communications Facility</t>
 <t id="5082">This station is an adapted dock whose main purpose is to monitor and keep track of all forms of communication. Normal traders are allowed on board to trade in its limited cargo space where one can find all forms of communication equipment, ranging from Advanced Satellites to the basic communication equipment.(||) Some other goods can also be traded here if in surplus or if needed by the stations civilian and military crew. Most sections of this station on one hand are out of bounds.</t>
 <t id="5091">Argon One</t>
 <t id="5092">{17,3112}</t>
 <t id="5111">Argon Merchant Scrapyard</t>
 <t id="5112">This station is run by civilian Scrap Merchants. They deal in old ship hulls that are no longer space worthy.(||) Whenever a ship is cashed in, the customer will get a fair shipment of ore from the Merchants in return. The rest of the materials are kept by the scrapyard to be sold later, be used for other purposes or disposed off. The stations cargo bays are usually filled with hulks of old ships that are yet to be processed, some could be repaired, while others are too badly damaged.</t>

 <t id="5203">Artefacts</t>
 <t id="5204">Relics of ancient civilisations can be found all over the universe. These artefacts vary in size and shape, but most were built with sophisticated advanced technology. The origins of these artefacts is still unclear and Argon and Boron archaeologists are working to decipher their purpose.</t>
 <t id="5213">Artificial Fertilizer</t>
 <t id="5214">In recent jazuras the Argon Agriculture Council has decided that it is unsafe to use Natural Fertilizer from the Argnu Cattle. This artificial fertiliser created by the AAC contains all the essential elements that plants need for growth, but eliminates the ones that are harmful to other life-forms.</t>
 <t id="5223">Biological Micro-Organisms</t>
 <t id="5224">These micro-organisms are used by the Boron to create new and advanced pharmaceuticals.(||) Using their advanced genetic techniques, the Boron have discovered many cures to previously incurable diseases. The regulation of these micro-organisms is now controlled in most sectors by the Boron Medical Council. The Boron actively search out new species and have discovered varieties that are used to manufacture fertilizer and to treat radioactive waste.</t>
 <t id="5233">Cartography Chips</t>
 <t id="5234">Designed and produced by the military, these cartography chips contain important information on individual sectors or the universe as a whole. They detail the positions of all known military facilities and stellar phenomena.</t>
 <t id="5243">Construction Equipment</t>
 <t id="5244">Modern construction equipment is designed to allow the construction of vast space stations safely and quickly. It is vital for the economic growth of all races.</t>
 <t id="5253">Engine Components</t>
 <t id="5254">Engine components are used in the manufacture and repair of spacecraft engines. The plasma drive is the most common engine system used in modern spacecraft.(||) It makes use of a high energy ionised plasma stream from a fusion core to propel the ship. These drives are very stable and simple in construction and need little maintenance.</t>
 <t id="5263">Entertainment Chips</t>
 <t id="5264">Entertainment chips contain films, books, or interactive entertainment. They are used throughout the known universe. Many Boron titles, however, have been banned in the Split sectors.</t>
 <t id="5273">Food Rations</t>
 <t id="5274">Small packs of food usually used in combat or refugee conditions.(||) These packs of food contain freeze-dried Argnu beef, dried BoFu and water rations. Although not appetizing, these foods can mean the difference between life and starvation.</t>
 <t id="5283">Hand Weapons</t>
 <t id="5284">There are many different designs of hand weapons to allow for the physical capabilities of each race. They range from Knives and swords to sophisticated military guns and rifles.</t>
 <t id="5293">Luxury Foodstuffs</t>
 <t id="5294">Many planets produce they own Luxury Foodstuffs that are coveted by connoisseurs all over the universe.(||) They are packed into refrigerated boxes and shipped quickly to their destination. Because of the cost and short shelf-life these foodstuffs are usually only used at important functions.</t>
 <t id="5303">Medical Equipment</t>
 <t id="5304">Medical equipment can be found all over the universe. This equipment can range from small medicinal bottles to life support systems and portable operating theatres.</t>
 <t id="5313">Mining Equipment</t>
 <t id="5314">Mining Equipment, produced by the Galactic Mining Authority, is used to repair or replace equipment on Asteroid Mines. The equipment ranges from the standard mining drill to advanced laser equipment.</t>
 <t id="5323">Nividium</t>
 <t id="5324">Nividium is a rare mineral that is found in some larger asteroid fields located in the universe. Its use is limited, although it has been used as a superconductor. Nividium in its purest form is traded as a unique and valuable commodity.</t>
 <t id="5333">Radioactive Waste</t>
 <t id="5334">Radioactive waste is by-product of weapon production, especially the Hornet Missile.(||) Until recently the only way to dispose of the waste was to dump it in disused silicon mines. The Boron have discovered a micro-organism in the sector Light Water that digests the harmful waste and excretes a inert material. How this useful radiation resistant organism evolved is unknown.</t>
 <t id="5343">Teladianium Panelling</t>
 <t id="5344">Teladianium panelling as produced in rolling mills at shipyards and when added to a ship's hull provides extra protection from space borne particles.</t>
 <t id="5353">Water</t>
 <t id="5354">Water is transported in large gas free containers all over the universe.(||) Many sectors have few natural sources of water and have to transport their requirements for drinking and cleaning. In these sectors the water supply is the most important commodity.</t>
 <t id="5363">Weapon Interface Chips</t>
 <t id="5364">More commonly known as WICs, these weapon interface chips are used in large laser based weapons. They are an interface between the ships computer and weapon, designed to help regulate the energy flow and to prevent illegal modification. Weapons cannot operate without these chips.</t>
 <t id="5373">Narcotics</t>
 <t id="5374">Narcotics are used widely within the pirate community. These drugs alter the person's perceptions and brain functions.(||) Unfortunately these effects cannot be controlled and the narcotics can usually result in unwanted side effects and in some cases death.</t>
 <t id="5383">Super Slave Chips</t>
 <t id="5384">Slave chips are a neural implant that is used to allow pilots of spacecraft to have direct control over his or her ship.(||) The Super Slave has better range using the same hub technology, improved perception, longer use and most importantly a built in fail safe device.</t>
 <t id="5393">Spacefly Eggs</t>
 <t id="5394">The eggs of the Markus Spacefly are very rarely found. It is believed that they lay their eggs in hollow asteroids when conditions are correct. Unfortunately it has become popular to collect unhatched eggs as they are very decorative with colourful patterns.(||) Trade in these items is illegal and any trader caught can expect a lengthy prison sentence.</t>
 <t id="5403">Pirate Sidearms</t>
 <t id="5404">Unlike the military issue hand weapons, these Pirate sidearms have been declared illegal by most races. They are popular amongst Pirates as they are very effect at short range and even minor wounds can be fatal.(||) The favoured pirate sidearm is the rare IMB-42 Blaster which literally rips the molecular structure of a living organism apart. Transportation and owning these weapons is a capital offence in some sectors.</t>
 <t id="5413">Hackerchips</t>
 <t id="5414">A new and expensive computer chip created by some raider parties. These Hacker chips are designed as an adaptive hacking tool, automatically redirecting signals, creating viruses and generally making a hacker's life easier.(||) They are easily identifiable because they contain their own power source - a small fusion battery that powers the chip for a Jazura.</t>
 <t id="5423">Military Personnel</t>
 <t id="5424">The military always have to move personnel around at short notice. For this purpose they often employ freelance pilots. These passengers usually carry weapons and other goods and their destinations might be dangerous.</t>
 <t id="5433">Passengers</t>
 <t id="5434">All races have access to commercial space craft, these ships can take large groups of passengers to space stations or to other planets or systems.</t>
 <t id="5443">Very Important Passengers</t>
 <t id="5444">A very special passenger with very special requirements for travelling. They usually have several security guards and travel with a large amount of luggage.</t>
 <t id="5453">Duplex Scanner</t>
 <t id="5454">Research and development of the Gravidar technology has resulted in the Duplex Scanner, with an increase in scanning range of a factor of two. Aim can thus be taken at targets from a much greater distance.</t>
 <t id="5463">Triplex Scanner</t>
 <t id="5464">The Triplex scanner increases the Gravidar scanner range by a factor of 3. This technology detects greater variations in the gravitational anomalies that are generated by stations.(||) This information is then processed and fed directly to both the sector map and the Gravidar display.</t>

<page id="19" title="Sectordescription" descr="Long descriptions of all sectors" voice="no">
 <t id="1030101">This sector contains one of the most varied selections of products in the known universe. Equipment, raw materials, ship upgrades and installations of many types can be traded here in a relatively secure environment. This is the Boron home world and a place of quiet contemplation and study.</t>
 <t id="1030102">The Boron produce high quality electronics and semi-organic computer systems as well as more conventional goods in this large and crowded sector. The supporting factories produce a wealth of raw materials for the local and export markets.</t>
 <t id="1030103">This sector provides cheap, clean power to all the Boron sectors. The Boron's ecologically sensitive ideology requires all power used in Boron sectors, even planetary power supplies, to be produced space-side.</t>
 <t id="1030104">The Boron and Teladi trade amicably in this peaceful sector. As with all Boron sectors, the economy is heavily reliant on agriculture and imported raw materials. The beguiling organic shapes of Boron Space Trading Stations are a constant reminder of their aquatic origins.</t>
 <t id="1030105">On the border between Teladi and Boron space, this system acts as a major commercial centre for trade between the Foundation and Profit Guilds, as well as providing large amounts of raw mineral resources. Although the Split rarely deign to trade with the Boron, both races trade with the Teladi. Much of this business between the feuding species occurs behind closed doors in this sector - all to the greater profit of the Teladi of course.</t>
 <t id="1030106">Once the favoured retreat of Boron philosophers and visionaries, this sector is now managed by the Teladi and has become the preferred destination of fun seekers, weedheads and space-hippies of every race. The Bliss Place in the centre of the sector produces the narcotic spaceweed, the meditative drug of choice for the dreamers, artists and neo-philosophers that are drawn here.</t>
 <t id="1030107">On the Split-Teladi border, this sector is the focal point for much of the limited trade between the Split and other species. The two Teladi systems between Family Whi and the nearest Boron system provide a buffer between the two feuding species. It is usual, however, to find Split on guard against the unlikely threat of a Boron sneak attack.</t>
 <t id="1030114">While the Teladi Company is not known for its military ventures, the population of this sector may choose to disagree. The Vault is a system hard to reach by normal means; this sector contains nothing but high tech stations. The Vault is also home to the Teladi Company's main research facility, always trying to improve upon current technology. Whilst this sector is relatively new, it is thought that it will be expanded further with new ship design and construction facilities. Work has already begun here on a replacement for the aging heavy freighters employed by Teladi traders.</t>
 <t id="1030117">Sector Is Not Recognised in the Database.</t>
 <t id="1030118">Discovered while exploring Getsu Fune, this sector was cleared of Xenon by a small force of ships, unfortunately soon after this mission was completed the Argon destroyer was ambushed. Its Captain's last report stated that the Xenon entered the sector from an unexplored gate, the position of which was not recorded. The Destroyer was never heard from again. The sector has rarely been entered since and is considered by the Argon to be somewhat cursed in its nature.</t>
 <t id="1030120">The existence of this sector was thought to be little more than a legend. That was until a lone Boron pilot, crazed with fear and exhaustion, was picked up in the Menelaus Paradise sector. He died shortly after rescue, babbling desperately about an eternal cosmic horror buried deep in the skin of a 'dark planet'. Since then Argon spy probes have been sent in to investigate; as of yet, no discovery has been made public.</t>
 <t id="1030201">On the border of Argon and Boron space the populated planets of this system are a popular vacation destination for Argon high society seeking safe, cosmopolitan surroundings. The very best in Argon cuisine is made in this system. The Equipment Dock provides a wide choice of weapons and upgrades for combat ships and pleasure-cruisers alike.</t>
 <t id="1030202">Sometime before the last Xenon conflict the planet 'Shipfall' was blown apart by a mysterious disaster of awesome magnitude. The shock-wave eradicated all installations in this area - at the time a thriving Argon industrial colony. Some effort has been made to re-establish the colony since, but its activities are currently restricted mainly to mining and agriculture.</t>
 <t id="1030203">This sector was once occupied by the Argon Federation's largest station, the Antigone. It was attacked in 215 by the largest Xenon fleet known to date. The station launched its defence fleet when one of the Xenon ships fired into the docking bays, destroying several fighter wings and setting off a chain reaction from damaged propulsion systems in the process. The station was destroyed, killing thousands of people. Some crew and visitors managed to make it out through emergency escape pods that were recovered once the Xenon had retreated. In one of the largest recovery efforts ever made by the Argon, medevac ships were dispatched to assist. One of these, the Springbird, was attacked while leaving the sector, forcing it into the atmosphere of the planet 'Sandwell'. All contact was subsequently lost. The recovery operation was extended to find survivors on the planet surface, none were ever located, perhaps due to the scorching heat from the local star. The outpost has now become a place of remembrance for the many Argon who travel here to honour their war dead.</t>
 <t id="1030204">This system supplies most of the weaponry used by the Boron Military in their sporadic battles against the Split, in addition to the defence of their systems from Pirate and Xenon raiders. As it is the main supply and outfitting depot for the Boron space-fleet, it is a prime target for Split attacks should hostilities resume between the two species.</t>
 <t id="1030205">The factory and refinery workers of Profit Share are renowned for working hard - and partying even harder. The Bliss place can be rough at a cycle's end - on refinery pay-day when the dice are loaded and the stakes are high, tempers can get frayed. The smokeshacks and speakeasies of Profit Share are commonly frequented by the more colourful Pirate crews.</t>
 <t id="1030206">With a wealth of untapped mineral resources and busy commercial and industrial installations, trade in the Teladi's home system is potentially very lucrative. Although well policed, the wealth of this system attracts opportunistic Pirate activity. To guard the profit of the many, a Teladi Destroyer often stands guard over this sector.</t>
 <t id="1030207">This system provides the Split with a wide variety of food and raw materials as well as being the production centre for their heavy ship's Pulse Beam Lasers. Far from the 'wild space' this system is relatively safe from pirate attack although occasional skirmishes are reported.</t>
 <t id="1030214">A highly defended system, for reasons that only the Teladi and few others know about. Shareholders Fortune is a new sector developed around a small field of large asteroids. The Teladi believed that this system would provide them with a source of Nividium, a rare material found in only some parts of the universe. After they found out their research ship was incorrect in this assumption the Teladi had to turn to building new factories for high-demand technologies.</t>
 <t id="1030215">When the Teladi Mining Executive came across this system, they sent several of their Explorer Ships to evaluate the system's resources. One of the ships, the Mercantile, came across abandoned space stations set into some of the mineral-rich asteroids. The technology seemed to be similar to the Argon, however they denied ever having held a presence there. The neighbouring system already belonged to the Teladi, so they quickly moved in, re-aligning the gates with the standard navigation system, near to the alien mines. After retrofitting the stations with Teladi technology, the largest Teladi mining operation in history opened for business.</t>
 <t id="1030218">This very remote system was discovered several Jazuras ago by chance by an adventurer. The governments of the individual races could not agree on who should administer this system in the future. In order to underline their own requirement in this area of space each race built space stations. Despite the hefty protests of the Patriarch of the Split, the female discoverer was appointed during the transition period as independent administrator of this region. Each government also sent their own space workers and colonists, transporters and combat ships, and even mighty destroyers to keep the peace in this virgin system. It was the desire of the discoverer of this system to name it after a ship, in which another female star warrior found her way into the X Universe. The system is now under administration by the Terracorp, who are starting to bring in their own stations and occupy empty spaces within the commerce grid.</t>
 <t id="1030219">The planet 'Oceania' is a huge world enveloped in swirling coloured mists and encircled with spectacular dust rings. It is a popular meditative resort for Boron monks who spend weeks in isolation in the planet's aquatic wilderness to contemplate the purpose and meaning of life. The installations here service these pilgrims' basic needs.</t>
 <t id="1030220">Although many ships have been sent to survey this sector, few have returned. Once shunned by all the sentient species, last surveillance records show the system was home to a pirate base that the Xenon constantly placed under attack. Pirate forces set this base up in search of easy pickings when the Xenon fleet jumped to the neighbouring grid 596, only to find the Xenon returned a few wozuras later. With access to the gate blocked, evacuation attempts were futile, leaving them with no option except to hold their position. Their survival in this sector is still a case for much debate.</t>
 <t id="1030301">This system is sparsely populated, dedicated purely to the production of raw materials and food for installations in the surrounding systems. The presence of weapons production facilities requires heavy protection by Federation ships against sabotage attacks from Pirates seeking to weaken Argon defences.</t>
 <t id="1030302">The Argon mine workers in this mineral rich system are famed across space for their ability to consume vast quantities of Space Fuel. Their semi-legal bootlegging operation keeps the miners happy and the bosses rich. Strong liquor loosens tongues and the system is a hive of gossip, rumour and dubious scuttlebuzz.</t>
 <t id="1030303">This Argon system's economy is heavily reliant on trade between the Argon and their Boron allies. The Foundation Guild has its Headquarters here and the Trading Station is the temporary seat of the newly founded Boron Chamber of Commerce. The many cattle ranches here supply Argnu Beef for the local and export markets.</t>
 <t id="1030304">The planet 'Tethys' has a huge population and the Boron are determined to protect the billions living there from the dangerous lawlessness of nearby 'uncivilised' systems. The local economy is very reliant on import of raw materials - most notably Teladianium which is required by the many Bio-Gas Factories.</t>
 <t id="1030305">This system is jealously guarded by the Teladi as it contains scarce organic and mineral resources. The seas of Phobass IV produce kilometre high waves - the best surfing in the universe bar none! The system has a thriving tourist trade based mainly on Boron day-trips to the Planet's many underwater resorts.</t>
 <t id="1030306">A relatively safe system, ideal for short trading runs and a debut in factory ownership. The Sun Oil Refineries in this system and more in the surrounding systems are reliant on imported sunrise flowers - making this an ideal location for a Solar Power Plant and Dream Farm.</t>
 <t id="1030307">Thuruks Pride produces a lot of the complex computers and hardware required by Split warships. Plentiful and cheap energy, and a variety of natural raw materials make this system a lucrative high-tech manufacturing center. Split and Paranid technology are combined in this sector to produce efficient and powerful beam weapons.</t>
 <t id="1030308">The home system of the Split, Family Pride is a major resupply point for the Split military as well as having a bustling civilian commercial district. Its primary planet houses the HQ of the Council of All Families - the martial government that rules over Split affairs.</t>
 <t id="1030310">Originally discovered and claimed by the Split Patriarch as a hideaway, this sector is now a thriving commercial colony. It is from here that the Split Patriarch ordered his forces to repel the attacks from the rebelling Family Rhonkar. In the final tazuras of the war, this sector was made impenetrable with three of the Patriarch's latest prototype destroyers. They managed to defend the sector with their armament of 20 plasma throwers per ship. The Rhonkar family eventually found a way around this blockade. They sent in a small fleet of heavy fighters that made a successful kamikaze run against the command vessel and destroyed it. Then a combined Rhonkar - Njy fleet attacked, eliminating the other two prototypes. The Patriarch was captured and deposed. The plans of these prototypes were lost in battle.</t>
 <t id="1030315">The border of Teladi and Split space in this part of the universe is located in this system. Trade between the Teladi and the Split Families T'kr and Njy usually takes place in this oddly designed system. Arranged by the Paranid sector designer, Almanckessat, this system's arrangement is thought to bring forth good fortune, to which the Paranid claim a great deal of in the name of their empire, much to the chagrin of the Teladi, to whom Home of Opportunity is the capital of their local sectors.</t>
 <t id="1030319">This small Boron outpost produces mineral products as well as the highly regarded Stotts Spices. It has attracted little hostile attention so far. The Boron tolerate the Split using this system as a convenient route to unexplored space in return for safe passage of Boron craft through certain Split systems.</t>
 <t id="1030401">This outpost of basic installations acts as a resupply point for all Federation ships in the area. It produces only the basic products most required by small ships and installations. The system is the spiritual home of the popular Argon sport known as 'Hardball'.</t>
 <t id="1030402">Bathed in the sacred light of the sun 'Sonra', the Argon home system is dominated by the planet 'Argon Prime'. This rich and beautiful world is densely populated and is usually protected by a large Argon Military force, a Titan Destroyer and more recently the Argon's latest flagship carrier, the Argon One, a Colossus class Carrier. Most of the needs of the Argon space fleet are catered for here in orbiting shipyards that also outfit private fighters and transport ships with Argon technology.</t>
 <t id="1030403">This system provides much needed power and food to the Argon Military as well as providing a convenient temporary HQ for the rapid response squads set up against Pirate activity and Xenon insurgence. It is often used as a base to recharge long range recon ships and carriers and as a result is a well defended and often dangerous system during times of conflict.</t>
 <t id="1030404">Originally discovered and declared lifeless by the earth science vessel 'Winterblossom', under the command of Rene Farnham, this system is now a lawless community of high-tech criminals. The illegal computer and weapons systems covertly built here are renowned for innovation if not reliability. None of which you will find publicly available. The hackers and cyberpunks who operate here are notoriously paranoid and are heavily guarded by armed enforcers.</t>
 <t id="1030405">Deep in unclaimed space this system is little more than a long established and well respected ambush. Rogue Teladi and Argon stations provide cover for aggressive Pirate strike forces. A single, cratered moon holds the wrecks of many of the ships disabled, stripped and left to fall to its surface by freebooters, hullcutters and privateers.</t>
 <t id="1030406">A busy and lucrative system with an economy dependent on high-quality electronics. Blue Profit is most famous as the source of the distinctive style of music devised by Teladi factory workers. Combining Teladi reed-whistles and Boron toneshells with Argon and Teladi percussion instruments, 'Teladi Blues' is appreciated by many sentient species.</t>
 <t id="1030407">The powerful Rhonkar Family runs this large Split weapons outpost. It is a heavily industrialized system with a lack of warmth and lays emphasis on functionality that is common to all Split space installations. Rhonkar Family warriors patrol their property efficiently and deal with unwanted guests with little courtesy.</t>
 <t id="1030408">This sparse system is primarily dedicated to the production of food. The Rastar Oil refineries rely on pirate stations for their supplies of space flies and import all other raw materials from outside the system. A dense, mineral-rich asteroid field fills the whole system. Split superstition forbids mining on the largest of these asteroids, claiming them to be cursed.</t>
 <t id="1030409">Prevented by the Argon from invading Boron territory, the Split have set out to colonise the space around their own systems. Tharka's Sun was the first of these new colonies, its mineral resources and agricultural plants providing raw materials for the Split push into new systems.</t>
 <t id="1030410">The Split secured this mineral rich system from the Xenon rearguard early after the last Xenon conflict but sustained heavy losses doing so. It now exists as a welcome, if rough, trading post on a busy route between many species' systems. Few communities hate the Xenon more than the inhabitants of this system.</t>
 <t id="1030415">This sector is home to the disgraced family T'kr, who were held responsible for a tragic incident that destroyed a Split shipyard and killed five hundred Split. What stopped this family from losing all of its assets was, the then Patriarch of All Split, using T'kr as a sign to all Split that such incidents will not be tolerated. Now the sector is home to all of the family's assets, and it has been only in recent jazuras that the sector has been visited by other families for trade. The sector also marks the border for the Teladi 'fortune' system block. Three sectors that the Teladi use for production, and also contain the stations that T'kr use as their main source of trade. The family's only destroyer patrols the system.</t>
 <t id="1030416">Once owned by the T'kr Family, this was a hub of activity. Mining was the main job here, but after the Dragon Incident this sector was seized by the neighbouring Njy family under orders from the Patriarch of all Split. Now the sector has run into disrepair, new stations have been built but are poorly maintained, pirate activity has increased and remnants of a minefield placed by T'kr to stop the seizure of the system can be found hidden in nebula streams. Pilots are asked to take caution in this system, as these mines could still be operational.</t>
 <t id="1030417">Founded to prevent the Boron expanding further in this area of space this Split colony is heavily guarded and produces surveillance equipment and defensive weapons, allegedly for protection against Boron aggression. A covert Federation intelligence group in turn watch the Split for signs of aggression against the peace loving Boron.</t>
 <t id="1030418">Located next to Split space this system is usually on a knife edge of tension. The Boron have no military presence here lest they give the Split an excuse to attack and instead rely on the covert intelligence and good will of other species to dissuade the Split from aggression.</t>
 <t id="1030419">This system was the centre of the Xenon weapons test zone during the last conflict. The system's planet was blown apart by an experimental weapon, probably the rumored 'Galaxy Killer' device - used to vaporise and ignite the still burning 'Hadesfire Nebulae'. It is now a laid-back Boron mining and farming colony.</t>
 <t id="1030501">The Argon military have taken full advantage of the rich resources in this area. Competition is fierce with many companies all competing for business. There are still profit opportunities, however, in mining for the export market. The station here acts as a resupply point for Argon Military fighters and a good selection of surplus weapon systems can be found there.</t>
 <t id="1030502">Scattered in the shadow of the now terraformed planet 'Kho's Haven', this recently re-colonised system's installations are mainly concerned with the production of high quality electronics and fabrics. Lax security arrangements make this system a favourite route for Pirate raiding parties looking for richer pickings.</t>
 <t id="1030503">Now little more than a smouldering shell, Presidents End stands testament to the ferocity of the Kha'ak. What little remains here has been left untouched, a silent memorial and burial ground to the countless souls who lost their lives, unable to escape this sector's final demise. With gates that link to areas that hold even greater anarchy, Argon security patrols struggle to maintain any semblance of control over the sector. Plans to rebuild are still held back by the fear of further reprisals. Perhaps in time Presidents End will see a new beginning, but until then this sector remains in mourning. </t>
 <t id="1030504">Despite the impression of respectability afforded to this system through the honoured name of Elena Kho, this asteroid-strewn colony is a favourite haunt of cut-throats, smugglers, wrecksweepers and hullcutters. The system has come to be a reliable, if illegal, source of controlled and specialized weaponry.</t>
 <t id="1030505">Weapons are required by many of the hidden outposts and illicit operations in unclaimed space. This system provides some of the necessary supplies and is protected by both a covert Pirate presence and a thick asteroid field. The mineral content of these asteroids is likely to cause a conflict between the smugglers and the legitimate mining corporations sooner or later.</t>
 <t id="1030506">Highly destructive PAC/PPC Weapons are built here under strict Teladi Military guard. Most of the personnel in this system are tied to the military arm of the Profit Guild or the smaller Teladi Company Navy. The market for recreational and luxury goods is high among those personnel on guard detail in a relatively safe system.</t>
 <t id="1030507">This system is the property of the Rhonkar Family, one of the dominant Split clans. Although this system was not always their property, it was seized during the last civil war with the Patriarch of all Split. Success here is ensured by slave labour, illegal mining methods and ruthless workforce control, this is not a matter that concerns the average Split.</t>
 <t id="1030510">Situated in a heavy asteroid belt this forbidding Split mining colony has grown into the second capital system of Split space. It is a successful trading location as well as providing much needed support for Split military ships. Run by the relatively liberal Thi Family this is the only Split system not using forced labour in its factories.</t>
 <t id="1030511">Established at the same time as 'New Income' this well organised Teladi system supports most of the ships travelling through newly colonised Teladi space. The inhospitable, rocky moon on the fringes of this system is used as a survival training ground for Teladi Company Profit-Protection troops.</t>
 <t id="1030517">This agricultural system is run by the brutally efficient Njy family. It produces many Split foodstuffs that are shipped to the two planets in this system and neighbouring systems. The Njy family is particularly brutal, offensive and arrogant, even by Split standards.</t>
 <t id="1030518">This system used to belong to the Split Family Ryk, but after a dispute with the Family Njy, was taken in a rather strange battle. Njy outfitted some of their freighters with large explosives and changed their transmitter signal to say they were from Family Whi, they later sent a distress signal saying they were under attack by pirates. The Ryk Family Carrier came in to assist the freighters that were near the west gate, but when it was in range each of the six freighters simultaneously exploded, heavily damaging the carrier. Njy then moved in their destroyers and attacked the Ryk's military forces, destroying the carrier with relative ease, and seizing the system in the name of the family Njy.</t>
 <t id="1030519">This is the home to the once great Ryk Family. After a territorial dispute with the Njy family, Ryk lost one of their two outposts. The second colony is this system, which was taken from the ownership of the last Patriarch who fell in a great battle with Family Rhonkar. Unlike some other systems in the local area, this system is relatively uninteresting, but one may find the odd skirmish between the neighbouring Boron colony and the Ryk Family. </t>
 <t id="1030601">This crowded system produces high quality food, clothing and computer equipment for the neighbouring systems. A strange religious sect reside here in a huge orbiting temple, searching for the secrets of sentient life in the Universe by studying ancient legends and deep historical analysis.</t>
 <t id="1030602">This mining outpost is surrounded by a field of mineral bearing asteroids with a particularly dense asteroid field to the north. Pirate activity is light and generally non-aggressive, mostly transports headed for the north gate. This is fortunate as high-speed combat in this system is made difficult by the asteroids which also play havoc with missile targeting scanners.</t>
 <t id="1030603">This quiet and unassuming system is a resupply point for the Argon military. Hostile activity is generally minimal as it is well guarded by security patrols. The space equipment dock is a useful source of surplus military equipment as well as second hand kit used by the many Argon Military training outposts in the area.</t>
 <t id="1030604">Much of the illicit trading in the known universe goes on in this system. Pirates and smugglers trade with all races and act as go-betweens for sensitive or illegal deals between species. There is a thriving industry in the cheap, counterfeit Paranid jewellery that is often used as conveniently anonymous payment in black market deals.</t>
 <t id="1030605">The last Xenon conflict with the sentient races brought forth many heroes. This system is named after one of the foremost of those who risked all to repel the Xenon threat. Although the name still has deep echoes of honour, courage and wisdom, the system is corrupt and dangerous. The Argon are particularly concerned that the use of this system as a base for the slave trade is an insult to one of their most honoured names.</t>
 <t id="1030606">Although this system is a hive of Agricultural and Industrial activity many respectable traders and merchants avoid it. Adventure seekers and rogues of all species frequent this system, the often Pirate Base is a real den of iniquity and squalor. This system is a major link in the Split - Teladi trade route and its safety is jealously protected by the Profit Guild.</t>
 <t id="1030607">On the fringes of civilised space this deep space system is no stranger to raids by pirates and other hostile ships. Founded by the Split leader Thuruk as a prison colony for Boron captured during their wars it has evolved into a thriving industrial outpost.</t>
 <t id="1030611">Situated between two uninhabitable dust planets this relatively new Teladi system produces raw materials as well as light weapons for military and exploration ships. This system is earmarked by the Profit Guild for priority expansion and investment.</t>
 <t id="1030612">This system is home to the organisation that controls the supply of the rare mineral Nividium. Its factories produce high-quality weapons for the Teladi as well as other general resources for the two planets in this sector. The system is guarded by the PTNI's security arm as well as Teladi Company ships.</t>
 <t id="1030614">This Argon colony was founded by Kleo Gult, head of the Argon Agricultural Council, but as work continued, it was discovered that more uses could be found for the system. The sector is owned by the AAC which means very little money has been put aside for updating non-essential technology. Residents have thus needed to find a way to make money apart from selling wares and produce. It is believed that there are some illegal goods being sold in the sector, but this has yet to be proven as residents police and protect this sector themselves. Streams of nebula also inhabit this system, and Circle of Labour is usually home to several scientists who try to find a way to mine this untouched resource. The system is unusual as the sun bursts with strong phases of intense light.</t>
 <t id="1030616">This system was once a Split mining outpost. One Tazura a distress signal from the colony was intercepted by Argon Federation security operatives in Black Hole Sun. When they investigated they found the entire system destroyed, its planet a shattered, radioactive hell. There has been no official explanation from any government concerning this disaster although rumours suggest a Xenon super-weapon is to blame and access to the system is now restricted. Pilots who passed though this system once said that there was a large ship in this system, but recently these reports have stopped. If this ship existed, then it is unknown where it has gone now.</t>
 <t id="1030617">This deep space system is about as close as the Split get to a civilian operation. It produces food and other organic products and mines the asteroids that are spread throughout the system. Although there is little military presence here all Split are required to complete combat training and civilian Split pilots are no easy target.</t>
 <t id="1030701">The Ore and Silicon mines in this system provide mineral resources to the entire Paranid Empire. These energy hungry mines operate continuously, their workers dedicating their labour to the glory of the Xaar. The Paranid Empire permits limited mining on the untapped asteroids in this sector but only Paranid may enter the sacred mines on the 'rusty planet' XylaXaar.</t>
 <t id="1030702">The jewel of the Paranid Empire produces some of the finest ship equipment available - devastating thermo-nuclear missiles, semi-organic ship hulls, artificially intelligent flight systems and highly powerful lasers are among the tech products to be found. The skies of Paranid Prime are dominated by a fiery gas cloud, the aftermath of a terrible Xenon experiment.</t>
 <t id="1030703">Although this system is primarily concerned with agricultural production, the factories in this system make it a prime target for raiding or sabotage. The stormy ringed planet that dominates this system is currently being terraformed by the Paranid for inhabitation in the near future.</t>
 <t id="1030704">This system manufactures hardware for the refit yards in Emperor's Ridge. It also provides masses of mineral and organic products to be consumed by their crews. Despite a heavy security around the military installations the Space Jewellery workshop provides rich pickings for the more aggressive and desperate looters and pirates based in nearby systems.</t>
 <t id="1030705">This lawless system is the hub of the black market in food and low-tech industrial produce. Many unscrupulous merchants have made a fortune trading illicit goods. Many, many more have been ripped-off, ambushed, swindled, bushwhacked, conned, assaulted, hijacked, stranded, killed or worse.</t>
 <t id="1030706">Bathed in the scorched glow of a burning nebula, this system was levelled by the devastating experimental weaponry used by Xenon forces in the last great conflict. Once a busy cosmopolitan trading outpost, it is now a rough and ready mining community run by smuggler overlords, possibly in the pay of the powerful Paranid Jewellery cartels.</t>
 <t id="1030707">After the Xenon conflict this system was abandoned. When the retreating Xenon completely destroyed a neighbouring system by forcing its twin suns to go nova, the colonies and factories of this system were eradicated. It is the home to many refugees of the last Xenon war and the other minor wars that came before it. The people here begin to build new lives and homes while they mourn their past and hope for their future.</t>
 <t id="1030708">One of the first systems to be colonised by the Argon after the last Xenon war. Aladna Hill was a supply and support base for the exploration of further systems. The jump gate used by the Xenon to retreat was left intact, allowing rapid exploration of the space beyond this system and the ruthless hunting of Xenon stragglers by rogue squads of revenge-seeking veterans.</t>
 <t id="1030709">The ageing but brilliant nuclear scientist, Akeela Hartnell, had one dream: to create a string of artificial suns that would light her way, and provide solar power for the ever expanding colonisation of sectors and planets by all races. The vessel that would allow Akeela to see her dream set off on its journey, but as it cleared the Omicron Lyrae system the ship was hit by an asteroid travelling so fast that it was virtually impossible to avoid, greatly damaging the ship. The crew, except for Akeela, disembarked and made their escape from the ship at best speed. Akeela succeeded in getting the ship away from the inhabited sectors, but the resulting explosion changed the sectors gate that locked onto the Aladna Hill sector. For a project that nearly ended in disaster, Akeela's Beacon is her gift to the people of the galaxy. A request by Akeela's last will and testament asked that the Argon govern the new system, but it should be a free place, and a safe haven for all traders. The four glowing stars that once graced this sector, - the result of Akeela's dream, are all but faded and gone. Yet her dream remains in the hearts of many, and so the sector is named after her.</t>
 <t id="1030712">Dedicated mostly to the production of Nostrop Oil for use in the industrial installations in the neighbouring systems, Scale Plate Green is situated in a small asteroid field near the garden planet 'Nature's Profit', the native home of the Swamp Plant and Sunrise Flower.</t>
 <t id="1030713">Named after the Argon heroine and Goner priestess Nyana Gunne, great-granddaughter of the famous Argon leader Nathan Gunne, this system was the location of some of the more colourful events in her life. It is now a rough place where times are hard and people harder. There is much illegal activity in this system and skirmishes are common.</t>
 <t id="1030714">Omicron Lyrae remains true to the courage and conviction of those who knew that this sector would not be the last will and testament to the battle fought against the Kha'ak. Here lie the souls of those not forgotten, those who understood that this would be the point at which all races would stand tall and take the battle onwards. Those remaining here are neither forsaken nor left without hope. Life goes on, while in the shadows lurk the destroyers of worlds.</t>
 <t id="1030715">This struggling Argon agricultural system is situated between the breathtaking planets 'Garleth Prime' and 'Garleth Beta'. Recent attacks on supply lines by Xenon forces have led to many fire-fights among the installations, asteroids and the busy trade routes in this system.</t>
 <t id="1030716">The furthest Federation outpost from Argon Prime, this dangerous system is both a deep-space resupply point and military tracking station. Xenon activity in this system is carefully monitored by a covert Federation branch who are rumoured to have an inaccessible base hidden near the storm-battered planet 'Hades'.</t>
 <t id="1030802">Perhaps the stunning gas nebulae that dominate the view in this system and the general atmosphere of peace and tranquillity are what inspire the gorgeous jewellery crafted by the Paranid here. The tiny masterpieces they craft from Majaglit can take years to complete and are collected avariciously by art enthusiasts from around the systems.</t>
 <t id="1030803">This highly agricultural system provides much of the Soja Beans that form the basis of the Paranid diet. The highly ionised water of the system's planet contains rare organic minerals that greatly improve the flavour of Beans nurtured in it. This system suffered particularly heavy losses in the last Xenon conflict.</t>
 <t id="1030804">This system contains the main Equipment Dock used to refit medium Paranid Fighters. These weapons are of the highest quality and Paranid technology is extremely reliable. This system was hit heavily in the last Xenon conflict and security is still tight. This system represents the far border of the 'Old Paranid Empire', the 'New Empire' consisting of territories claimed since the conflict.</t>
 <t id="1030808">This system serves as the source of ships and equipment for the Argon settlement of areas of space recently claimed after the Xenon conflict. The majority of traffic here is comprised of Argon scout ships and transports headed from newly founded colonies and the fringe systems.</t>
 <t id="1030811">This busy Teladi colony was named in honour of the warriors and civilians of all species who perished in the first great Xenon conflict. The system itself is sparse and lacks many basic comforts. The Teladi here are possibly even more avaricious and sneaky than their homeworld brothers.</t>
 <t id="1030812">There is no data on this sector save that it contains a huge watery planet known by the Boron as 'Saa-Russ' or 'Life of the Sea' which legend insists is inhabited by giant sea dragons. Many ships have set out to explore this system, though very few have returned.</t>
 <t id="1030816">This strange system is named for a goner belief that Nathan R Gunne once visited this system, the reason for this belief is that when first entered, a piece of debris was found, after an investigation it was found to be from two ancient fleets. All the debris has been cleared up and a new system has been forged in the brown nitrogen dioxide nebula streams of the system. Pirate activity is also increased and has meant increased military patrols in this system. Many pilots tend to avoid the gas clouds, as pirate ships have been known to hide in the nebulae and then participate in surprise attacks. The local population are made of mixed labour level, from high tech support to miners.</t>
 <t id="1030817">The original name for this sector was Light of Hope, until the Xenon attacked many jazuras ago. It was clear that the sector's patrols wouldn't hold out against further attacks so the colony was prepared for evacuation using small transport ships. Backup from the Argon Military was sent; four Titan class destroyers and two Colossus Carriers, complete with fighter wings. They were to escort the transport ships out of the system, but before they could get to the gate, Xenon ships jumped in and overwhelmed the destroyers and carriers. All civilian ships and one destroyer, the Challenger, escaped. Three jazuras later, an Argon force, with Boron assistance, took back Light of Hope and it was renamed Wastelands, reflecting the carnage and debris that the force found.  Now cleared of that detritus and with the Xenon threat now greatly diminished, its inhabitants strive to maintain a normal existence.</t>

 <t id="1030902">The name is deceiving, but there is a meaning. The sector is located close to the Ma'kare star; the dominating feature is the flare that streams though the system. Because the stations are located so close to the star, all stations were fitted with a new reflective Teladianium armour that allow for the flares to hit the station and only affect it slightly. Although the shields do protect the stations by absorbing 80 percent of the energy, the rest is reflected back by the armour. The name comes from the high priest, who visited this sector shortly after discovery. Back then the flare was still at a distance, and the moving star was also at a distance, so the sector was a void. Many religious Paranid thought that the star that was drawing closer was an omen and so many preachers came to see this, hence the name.</t>
 <t id="1030904">Despite fanciful miners' tales that the asteroids in this system are all made of solid Nividium they seem to be rich in only the more mundane ore and silicon. The two factories producing cheap, commercial jewellery for the export market are well defended against opportunistic attack but attract the occasional raids from determined freeloaders.</t>
 <t id="1030906">With the discovery of the North Gate in the neighbouring 'Shore of Infinity' sector, Light Water was founded. With a mixture of food production and solar power generators, this system has grown in importance. The name Light Water was given to this sector as the only habitable planet has an unusually low gravity for its size, its surface being mostly covered in water. The Boron have recently founded a planet-based colony using materials that were destined for the LooManckStrat's Legacy system before plans were scrapped.</t>
 <t id="1030908">This mining outpost is still being founded near the red gas giant 'Hitt's Eye'. The trading, food and materials installations are in place and waiting to service the eagerly awaited private mining outfits who are always looking for new sources of minerals.</t>
 <t id="1030910">The Teladi claimed this system with the sole intention of colonising the two massive planets here. The awful fate of the first scouting parties to the planets' surfaces and the discovery of the hostile nature of the indigenous life forms dwelling there have ended such plans and the system is slowly decaying into a place of fear, lawlessness and anarchy.</t>
 <t id="1030911">The Teladi have only recently re-discovered this historically important system. Ianamus Zura already has its own thriving economy, mainly due to its position on a busy trade route. It provides a broad range of raw materials to many neighbouring systems and serves as the HQ of both the Profit Guild and Teladi Company in the new territories.</t>
 <t id="1030917">Interworlds is so called because of its strange arrangement of planets; two planets inhabit the system and create a bottleneck with the jump gate route. The entire system was only accessible via one lone gate when first discovered. Originally an agricultural colony built by the Argon to supply food supplies to rest of the Argon Federation, Interworlds has expanded to include more high tech stations and products. It is also home to the 4th Argon Expeditionary Force, which is still looking for any new gate routes that can be used. </t>
 <t id="1031002">The last great Duke came to this sector and after a few short stazuras being in the system he collapsed and fell into unconsciousness. When he woke up he claimed he had visions of a great battle in this system between the Paranid and a strange alien race, now known to be the Kha'ak. The Great Duke decided to consult the monks at the Great Monastery on Paranid Prime in the valley of the setting star. His visions did not occur again and he was granted permission to set up a new temple in this system where he first had his vision. He died without ever knowing the true nature of his visions, or the horror that would follow. </t>
 <t id="1031003">This sector is considered to be one of high importance. In ancient times the Emperor's palace in the high mountains of the Paranid Homeworld became so cold the ice would keep away any travellers. The Emperor chose on such occasions to stay at his winter palace in the equatorial region. When the Xenon nearly destroyed Paranid Prime's atmosphere, the equatorial region was all but lost. Until recently the Emperor stayed at his palace in the mountains, accessible because of the heat from the Xenon experiment. In order to keep with tradition he set up a new winter palace in this sector, overlooking a great lake at the foot on the Kar Miat Mountains. In the winter of Paranid Prime's northern hemisphere, the Emperor usually occupies this sector with his advisory Dukes, keeping the long tradition that was lost for so long.</t>
 <t id="1031004">This system's heavy security is due to its principal export - Jewellery and Maja Snails. The wild and untamed twin planets here are home to a nomadic workforce, famous for their expertise in raising the delicate snails. These shy, reclusive Paranid tend Snail Farms across all known space. The most valuable installations in this system are protected on two sides by artificially constructed asteroid belts.</t>
 <t id="1031005">Despite being the furthest Paranid system from Paranid Prime the Xaarist Priests run Preacher's Refuge with strict religious fervour and propriety. Their quiet and devoted worker-monks produce exquisite jewellery, inspirational 'Xja' poetry and the very best in automated, semi-intelligent weapons.</t>
 <t id="1031006">Of little use to the Paranid, this system is leased by the Boron who have a budding outpost of refineries and chemical plants here. Limited trade between the Paranid and Boron takes place here and relations between the species are amicable. In return for Paranid protection the Boron lend their extensive knowledge in biochemistry to the Paranid efforts in cyber biology.</t>
 <t id="1031007">This asteroid scattered system provides much of the organic supplies required by the 'New Boron Colonies'. Many of the ships used in building and servicing the surrounding Boron systems are built here.</t>
 <t id="1031008">This new Boron colony is being constructed with the aid of the Argon. After heavy losses in the Split and Xenon conflicts the Boron are eager not to confine themselves to one cluster of systems as they have in the past. The foundations of a thriving mining colony have already been completed and stage two is well underway.</t>
 <t id="1031009">This busy Boron mining colony doubles as a refit and supply centre for Boron ships working the new colonies. Harsh conditions and pirate raids make the Boron who dwell here harder and more cynical than their compatriots nearer the Boron home systems.</t>
 <t id="1031010">This system is typical of small scale Teladi trading outposts. It produces Teladi speciality goods as well as traditional foodstuffs both for local and export markets. The Teladi merchants here trade mainly with the Boron living in neighbouring space but naturally they welcome any visitor with credit to spare.</t>
 <t id="1031104">Being the first and only Teladi Sector located next to a Paranid Sector, the Teladi opened this sector for massive amounts of trade, but trade with the Paranid was not a sensible decision. Turnover was low and few Paranid passed through sectors with only the odd ship coming in for supplies. The Teladi Chairman for this sector noticed they were slowly going into debt and so pulled out most of the high tech factories. The sector was then dubbed Bad Debt and the name has since stuck. Although relations between the two races are improving, trade is increasing at a minimal rate. Because of this debt the Teladi trade dock is relatively quiet, with cargo bays remaining empty and most market sections closed off and in a state of decay.</t>
 <t id="1031110">This dark system is located on the far edge of the Garenisk Void, a large area of space where no stars can form. The remnants of an ancient battle were found in this system by a Boron fleet on its first pass through this system. Subsequently many jazuras of archaeology and recovery was undertaken with the assistance of the Argon. After the system was cleared of debris, Boron colonial ships were cleared to move in, but the jump into the system did not go as planned. On entry, they found themselves in the middle of a pirate ambush. The fourteen colonial passenger and freighter ships were destroyed with the capture of some smaller craft. Over two thousand Boron were killed. The pirates have since planted a large minefield in the hope of capturing other ships; travel through this system should be taken with great care.</t>
 <t id="1031202">Sector Is Not Recognised in the Database.</t>
 <t id="1031203">This sector contains one half of Family Rhy's assets. They use this system as a supply depot to passing split craft. The planet's main colony consists of a large geodesic dome. Inside one can find large amounts of weaponry being sold in armoury markets. Pirate activity in this system is also increased because of the local activity, but the Rhy Family does nothing to stop this. Being on the border of the local Teladi Sectors, Rhy's Desire can usually find large numbers of Teladi coming in to trade and purchase these illegal goods.</t>
 <t id="1031204">The pride of the local Teladi sectors is this colony; the high tower of the Ministry of Finance stands high on the planet's surface. The Ministry was set up to oversee the Company's finances when setting up new sectors, although this wing of the Teladi Company wasn't entirely successful. When the neighbouring system, Bad Debt, was first opened to the public, the sector ran into trouble and the Ministry was held responsible. The colony skyline is dominated by the 80 story tower that casts a shadow over the gardens of trade, a large garden filled with markets and made more appealing to visiting Argon and Boron traders. </t>
 <t id="1031210">This sector was worthless to other races, inaccessible by other races because of the minefield in the sector to the north. This sector was originally a boron research sector, and with a handful of stations this colony was a working one. When the colony plans for LooManckStrat's Legacy fell though after a pirate attack this colony had to be abandoned. Some stations were scuttled while others were later reactivated by pirate forces who have now laid claim to this system.</t>

 <t id="1031217">Sector Is Not Recognised in the Database.</t>
 <t id="1031303">The lesser family of Rhy, in the days before space colonisation, spent most of their time on Split Prime, using their knowledge of espionage and sabotage to plunder other families resources and claim them as salvage. Rhy moved off-world to their own system when they became a more powerful family, after helping the family Rhonkar in their battle against the old Patriarch. This sector contains half of the family's assets in space trading, including their own carrier. Rhy no longer focuses solely on espionage and have started to build up their own military. There are also rumours in local bars of a hidden gate in or near to this system.</t>
 <t id="1031310">This rogue sector is on the main trade lane between old sectors and more recent expansions of the Paranid Empire. A small trading post that runs itself independently from other races. It has little or no police, with pirate raiding parties taking the opportunity to seize power in this system. Most ships that come though this sector can be expected to come under some form of attack, and with the Paranid not willing to send in forces to assist ships with the exception of other Paranid traders, there is little chance of official help.</t>
 <t id="1031316">Sector Is Not Recognised in the Database.</t>
 <t id="1031401">The RBMD or Royal Boron Military Defence, system 'Depths of Silence', was formed to build new ships and develop new technologies. This system is heavily guarded in case of attack by Xenon or other forces hostile to the Boron Navy. The sector is filled with high-tech Boron Stations, including those that specialise in the production of new Boron weapons systems. Entrance to this system is granted if you're carrying cargo to this system, or if you have previous access rights.</t>
 <t id="1031402">This system is rumoured to have a hidden gate leading to a Boron military facility. If you enter this system there is a great possibility that the local military police force will scan your ship; if you have hostile intentions you will be attacked. It is this tightened security that has led to these rumours. The sector itself is a small trade outpost with little need for high tech goods.</t>
 <t id="1031403">Located near the giant star of Lehril, this system is a source of strategic power for the Boron. Being a border colony to the local Split Family, this sector also acts as a crossroads for other Boron settlements, making it particularly important for passing trade. It is guarded by a lone destroyer with escorts, thus pirate activity here is minimal.</t>
 <t id="1031404">This system was originally empty with a few asteroids creating a barrier near the gate, this was until the Boron moved the gate away from the vein of asteroids. Barren Shores today has become a thriving trade colony with exports being high. Whether high-tech goods are available at this time is unknown.</t>
 <t id="1031409">This sector was formed shortly after the claiming of the sector to the south. Set up originally as a monastery, it provided a place for the passing priests to pray and hold quiet meditation. Military forces were virtually non-existent during early settlement, leaving the monastery open to attack by raiding parties from the nearby Pirate sectors. The Priests held their position in the safety of the temple caverns for several Tazuras before the Paranid managed to get a destroyer in the sector to protect it. The destroyer has now moved to the next sector to prevent such insertions into Paranid territory.</t>
 <t id="1031410">With most of the Paranid now in space-borne colonies, the high priest of the Paranid chose to seek a new Cardinal to set up his religious sections in the new Duchy Systems. This sector is now home to the Cardinal who chose this sector for the capital of the Second Duchy. The system boasts shipyard facilities, and equipment docks, as well as being guarded by a Destroyer ship, mainly for protection from the Pirates from past the north gate.</t>
 <t id="1031411">When the Paranid first entered this system they found an empty sector accessible by two gates, but the planet remains a mystery here. There are a few remnants of a civilization with one relic - a needle-like object made from stone that stands 3 stories high, in the middle of what may have been a city. At the foot of the monument a large gemstone was found inside a carved stone case. After prolonged surveys it was discovered that there was once a large building here, which was thought to be a temple. Scientists today are still trying to understand what the script on the needle object means.</t>

 <t id="1031417">Sector Is Not Recognised in the Database.</t>
 <t id="1031503">This sector holds a major settlement recently set up by the Boron, a construction colony based on ship production. The system is named for the nebula that is located nearby. The colony itself has facilities for both families and the military, with municipal recreation domes containing restaurants, water-parks and marinas.</t>
 <t id="1031509">Spring of Belief was originally a Boron sector named "Queen's Paradise". An accident during a scientific experiment on the planet's surface released vast amounts of radiation. Soon after, the local population started to die of a mysterious disease. When it was discovered that the radiation was the cause, the Boron Government ordered an evacuation of the sector. Xenon fleets also tried to inhabit the sector, but the radiation affected electronic systems onboard their craft. As the radiation grew weaker the Paranid finally settled in this system and claimed it as their own. With the radiation now a minor problem the Boron Government has tried to reclaim the system, but the Paranid Government refuses to give up their tenure.</t>
 <t id="1031510">This sector is occupied by one planet and the remains of its only moon. It is unknown how the moon was destroyed in this manner, but the fallout has caused the planet's atmosphere to become irradiated, leaving it deadly to all forms of life. When the Paranid moved in, they set up a standard colony with basic resources. Hopefully in time more will be built.</t>
 <t id="1031511">This is last sector to be occupied in the New Duchy Sectors. This sector is famed for its lack of hospitality. It is said to be a retreat for the Pontifex in case he needs to leave the main sectors and be out of contact for one reason or another. Deep within the Second Duchy, this sector is hard to reach, especially with the pirate sectors inhabiting a route into this area. </t>

 <t id="0">Q193_NORMAL_MISSION - Food Rations</t>
 <t id="1">[title]Refugee Crisis Imminent! $TRADERANK$ Pilots required![/title]\n\n[justify]A message for all pilots with a clean, good condition $SHIPTYPE$ vessel. Time is short, so this communication will be brief. It seems there has been a period of conflict near to $THERESECTOR$ which has caused many races to flee to safer sectors. Most of them are now being held in the $THERE$ but there is a problem. This station is not equipped to handle so many at one time. Whilst they have sufficient Medical Equipment, they are running very low on Food Rations. We really need to get some there soon. The authorities fear that if they do not receive any within $TIMELIMIT$ then the refugees may attempt to storm the station and seize it by force. Therefore a $SHIPTYPE$ class craft is needed to deliver $AMOUNT$ units of Food Rations there within $TIMELIMIT$.\n\nOnce hired, the pilot will be paid $REWARD$ for his troubles and if he gets there fast enough he may get up to $BONUSREWARD$ as well. We are confident there are many pilots here who look up to such a benevolent mission.[/justify]</t>
 <t id="2">Keep going pilot - you only have $TIMELEFT$ remaining to deliver the goods</t>
 <t id="3">That's fantastic! You've made it well ahead of schedule. I'm more than impressed with your skills pilot.\n\nHere is your reward. I was going to pay you just $REWARD$ but instead I'm going to give you an additional $BONUSREWARD$ as well on account of the time you've saved and the skills you've shown. Well done! We'll be in touch again I'm sure.</t>
 <t id="4">Pilot, this is $AUTHOR$ from the $HERE$, you procured some $WARES$ from us recently as you may recall. Well, even though you were a good pilot in our books, it looks like you don't have the necessary standing to deliver the $WARES$ to the station. Something appears to have happened that has caused them to deny you docking rights. We're not sure what but it doesn't seem good. I'm afraid we're going to have to take your name off the list of pilots we can trust. Your payment of $REWARD$ has been revoked. Sorry but the contract has been cancelled.</t>
 <t id="5">Excellent. You qualify for this trading run. Remember that you have $TIMELIMIT$ to get to the $THERE$ in $THERESECTOR$. The amount placed aboard your ship is $AMOUNT$ units of $WARES$. Well don't just stand there, get going!!</t>
 <t id="6">Get lost, can't you read or is your translator broken? You need to be at least $TRADERANK$ or higher to cope with this mission</t>
 <t id="7">You have docked at the $THERE$. You have my gratitude for completing the journey. Here is your payment, $REWARD$ as agreed. </t>
 <t id="8">You have arrived at the $THERE$, late. This is quite unacceptable. Your payment has been reduced to $REWARD$. Your skills as a pilot leave much to be desired. </t>
 <t id="9">Pilot, You either have a severe memory problem, or you just don't have a clue how to get there. Time has run out and you aren't even close to the $THERE$. As for the payment of $REWARD$ that I was due to pay you, well that just isn't going to happen anytime soon.</t>
 <t id="10">When did you last check your ship? It's not a $SHIPTYPE$ craft. Stop wasting our time</t>
 <t id="11">I'm sorry, it appears that you do not have the necessary storage space needed for this mission. You need a ship that can maintain at least $HOLDREQUIRED$ units. You currently have just $PLAYERHOLDLEFT$ units. You're either incredibly bad at basic Goner arithmetic, or plain stupid. Your authorisation will be reviewed when you have increased your storage capacity. Until then, either dump some cargo or get a bigger ship.</t>
 <t id="12">I'm sorry but you appear to have had some problems with the owners of the $THERE$ in $THERESECTOR$ that prevents you from docking there. We don't know what's been happening in your past, but we don't want to be a part of it. We'll find someone else who can get the wares to where we want them to be shipped. </t>
 <t id="13">Pilot, it appears that you have betrayed our agreement. We specifically requested that you deliver the $AMOUNT$ $WARES$ to the $THERE$ in $THERESECTOR$. Unfortunately you do not seem to have taken this instruction onboard. We have received word from the $THERE$ that they have only received $PLAYERSAMOUNT$ units of $WARES$. The hangar crew have confirmed you were given $AMOUNT$ of these items. Payment for this shipment has been cancelled and your ship id has been passed onto all relevant authorities. Do not think you are going to get away with this, the consequences of your actions will soon begin to make themselves clear. Communication Closed!</t>

 <t id="101">[title]Urgent delivery of Weapon Interface Chips required[/title]\n\n[justify]All pilots of $TRADERANK$ or higher are requested to assist in the shipment of a batch of Weapon Interface Chips that are behind schedule. All cargo ships on this station have currently been impounded following investigations by authorities over a possible payment error to a recent trader. For this reason, we require $AMOUNT$ units of WIC's to be shipped to $THERE$ in $THERESECTOR$ immediately. \n\nAny pilots who are at least a rank of $TRADERANK$ with their own $SHIPTYPE$ craft are requested to ship the cargo to $THERE$ within $TIMELIMIT$. Payment of $REWARD$ will be made on completion of the mission, and up to an additional $BONUSREWARD$ for swift couriers who make it there sooner. If successful, future work will no doubt be offered in due course.[/justify]</t>
 <t id="102">$TIMELEFT$ remaining and counting. $THERE$ are counting on you, make best speed Pilot!</t>
 <t id="103">You have reached the $THERE$ in good time. Your timekeeping is quite impressive. The payment of $REWARD$ has been transferred to your account, but you will also find an extra $BONUSREWARD$ on top of the $REWARD$ originally promised. Job well done!</t>
 <t id="104">It looks like something's happened to make you distinctly unpopular in $THERESECTOR$. You can no longer dock at the $THERE$ to complete your shipment of the $WARES$. While we're not going to start interrogating you about your actions, we are going to drop you from our books like a hot cahoona. Your payment of $REWARD$ has been cancelled. You're going to have to look elsewhere for work with a station that doesn't have any concerns about where you fire your lasers. </t>
 <t id="105">Your information checks out and you have been accepted for hauling this cargo. Note that you only have $TIMELIMIT$ to get the $AMOUNT$ $WARES$ to $THERE$ in $THERESECTOR$.</t>
 <t id="106">You're ranking is lower than $TRADERANK$ - I wouldn't trust you with delivering the mail, let alone our $WARES$. Go away!</t>
 <t id="107">Excellent. You have reached the $THERE$ on time. Payment of the $REWARD$ as agreed has been made directly to your account. Your mission has been completed. You are free to undertake further contracts or continue about your travels. </t>
 <t id="108">Something tells me that you haven't cleaned the spaceflies out from your engines in a long while. Your experience as a pilot leaves much to be desired, I've seen Argnu with better navigation skills. Your payment has been reviewed and consequently reduced. You will find the sum of $REWARD$ has been transferred to your account. Goodbye!</t>
 <t id="109">I could have sworn I asked you to get to the $THERE$. What part of that order did you not understand pilot?! There's no point in paying you a single credit, you just don't deserve it seeing as your ship is no where near the destination. The $REWARD$ originally destined for your account will be used to find a pilot who actually knows what he's doing.</t>
 <t id="110">If only I had 10 credits for every time a pilot like you wasted my time. You need a $SHIPTYPE$ craft to perform this mission</t>
 <t id="111">There does not appear to be enough cargo capacity in your ship to hold all of the $WARES$. You need at least $HOLDREQUIRED$ units in order to take on this mission. You currently have just $PLAYERHOLDLEFT$ units. Unless you do something to balance the two figures out, you can't undertake this mission! Go sell some cargo or get a larger bay, just don't come back until you've learned how to add and subtract!</t>
 <t id="112">We're not going to be able to use you as a pilot I'm afraid. It looks like the $THERE$ in $THERESECTOR$ doesn't like you as much as you might have thought. We're not sure why, but we're going to have to look elsewhere for a pilot who is worthy of their docking rights. </t>
 <t id="113">I can't believe it! Wasn't the payment of $REWARD$ enough for you? Apparently you took it upon yourself to make some of the $WARES$ we had asked you to ship part of your reward too. This is unacceptable. If the $THERE$ are to be believed, and I have more reason to believe them than I do you, they have only received $PLAYERSAMOUNT$ units of $WARES$ from your ships cargo bay. Back here the cargo inventory systems have confirmed that you were given $AMOUNT$ of these items! We've been doing business with companies in $THERESECTOR$ for longer than you've been flying, this is the first time we've had a Pilot go rogue on us. So, it looks like we're going to have to revoke your payment of $REWARD$ and place you on the list of Pilots who can't keep their word, let alone their cargo!</t>
 <t id="200">Q193_NORMAL_MISSION - Entertainment Chips</t>
 <t id="201">[title]Latest Entertainment Chips ready for Release![/title]\n\n[justify]The latest version of the popular Entertainment Chips are now in full production. Representatives for the distributors are awaiting test stock at $THERE$ in $THERESECTOR$. There are $AMOUNT$ units to deliver. You will need a $SHIPTYPE$ class craft and rank of at least $TRADERANK$ to do so.\n\nIf you can get them there within $TIMELIMIT$ we will reward you with a payment of $REWARD$. If you can get them there earlier, we can surprise the market with an early release and you could get up to $BONUSREWARD$ extra. Applicants must be aware that disclosure of any information regarding this hardware is strictly prohibited prior to the release.[/justify]</t>
 <t id="202">I've seen faster spaceflies, but unlike them, you only have $TIMELEFT$ remaining</t>
 <t id="203">You have reached the $THERE$. Thank you for getting the $WARES$ to $THERE$ so quickly. Here is your payment of $REWARD$. We are more than happy to offer you the bonus of $BONUSREWARD$ on top of the original payment. You travel light, travel fast, and you do it well. Should some express freight transport be needed in future, you will be on our lists.</t>
 <t id="204">Hey! I don't think you're going to be able to dock at the $THERE$ in $THERESECTOR$ anymore to deliver your $WARES$. What in Splits Fire are you doing out there!? The $THERE$ has notified us that they have marked you down for neutralization should you return anywhere near their station. Whatever it is you've done, it looks like we're not going to be able to pay you the $REWARD$  we had reserved for completion of your shipment. Sorry but you're no longer on our list of pilots we'd like to have work for us. Find your haulage contracts elsewhere from now on. </t>
 <t id="205">Ok great, looks like a fast ship to get the $AMOUNT$ $WARES$ to $THERE$ in $THERESECTOR$. $TIMELIMIT$ is a little bit restrictive so you better get a move on.</t>
 <t id="206">Sorry pilot - you need to be $TRADERANK$ or higher to help us with this mission. Come back when you have more experience</t>
 <t id="207">You have arrived at the $THERE$ in good time. I'm happy to pay you the $REWARD$ as per our agreement. Your skills as a pilot are worthy of note. Perhaps you should enlist as a transport pilot full time?</t>
 <t id="208">You have finally docked at the $THERE$. Due to the extreme amount of time taken to reach the station, your payment has been reduced to $REWARD$. This sum has already been transferred to your account. It is suggested that you use this money to purchase some sector maps and perhaps a few extra engine tunings. It looks like you need them. </t>
 <t id="209">You are quite incredible, you seem to know how to dock at every single station apart from the $THERE$ where you were actually asked you to go! Your payment of $REWARD$ is staying in my account, you won't be getting any of it!</t>
 <t id="210">I said only $SHIPTYPE$ class craft would be good enough for this mission, can't you read?</t>
 <t id="211">Your ship is not equipped with the necessary cargo space in order to complete this mission. The shipment requires a minimum of $HOLDREQUIRED$ units. It appears that you have just $PLAYERHOLDLEFT$. I do not think I need to continue any further. Please obtain the correct level of storage space before attempting to gain authorization for this mission. </t>
 <t id="212">We'd like to be able to take you on as our pilot, but it seems the owners of the $THERE$ in $THERESECTOR$ have other plans in mind. They consider you a threat to their station. Thanks for the interest though. We'll be sure to be in touch when your reputation has improved. </t>
 <t id="213">Attention, we have just received word from the $THERE$ that you have not delivered all of the $WARES$ that we loaded onto your ship. Is there a problem, pilot? We specifically agreed on a payment of $REWARD$ for the shipment of $AMOUNT$ $WARES$ to the $THERE$. It seems that from this original agreement, you have taken it upon yourself to only ship $PLAYERSAMOUNT$, so where are the rest of the units? This is not something we consider to be either funny or conducive to a good business partnership. Your ship ID has been registered with the authorities. Your payment of $REWARD$ has been revoked. Do not think this will do your standing in the local sectors any good at all, pilot.</t>
 <t id="300">Q193_NORMAL_MISSION - Cartography Chips</t>
 <t id="301">[title]Nebulae Gas Causes Damage To Station!! Help!!![/title]\n\n[justify]News of an incident at the $THERE$ in $THERESECTOR$ involving a long-distance freighter has just been received. A discharge of nebulae gas into station electronics by the vessel has meant that many of the cartography systems have sustained irreparable damage. Cartography Chips are now urgently required in order that correct navigation and course mapping be continued. Pilots who have control of $SHIPTYPE$ class craft are asked to assist in the shipment of the Cartographic Hardware. Your trade rank must be at least $TRADERANK$. The greater experience you have however, the more successful you will be. With no spare Cartography Chips available, it has been confirmed that $AMOUNT$ chips from this station $HERE$ are to be couriered to $THERE$ in order that all systems remain operational.\n\nAs advised, pilots will require a $SHIPTYPE$ vessel. Shipment of the cargo within $TIMELIMIT$ is your priority task. You will receive payment of $REWARD$ on completion and installation of the goods. Couriers able to reach the destination earlier will receive up to an additional $BONUSREWARD$ for their skill and precision. Please contact Station authorities on acceptance of this mission. Goods will be loaded onto your ship immediately.[/justify]</t>
 <t id="302">Keep it steady pilot, don't forget the $REWARD$ waiting for you if you complete the delivery within the next $TIMELEFT$</t>
 <t id="303">You've managed to make good time, thanks for making the effort in getting the $WARES$ to $THERE$ on time. The bonus of $BONUSREWARD$ is yours!! And of course the initial $REWARD$. Thanks for the help.</t>
 <t id="304">Pilot, mission is aborted! We've just received comms from the $THERE$ in $THERESECTOR$. It appears that they have revoked all docking privileges for your ship as well as your id. They have asked us to notify you that you can take the $WARES$ you were due to ship to them and shove them up your plasma ducts. We're not too sure what it is you've been doing out there, but the payment of $REWARD$ is no longer available to you. The contract has been cancelled. Find someone else to play your games with. </t>
 <t id="305">Hmm well everything appears to check out. The $AMOUNT$ $WARES$ are on board. $THERE$ in $THERESECTOR$ are expecting you in $TIMELIMIT$ or less. Good Journey Pilot!!</t>
 <t id="306">You must be $TRADERANK$ or higher to help us here. Go get some practice under your belt and then come back</t>
 <t id="307">Ah, you're there! You may not be the best pilot around, but you're certainly the most reliable. As agreed, here's the payment of $REWARD$. Go buy yourself a drink!</t>
 <t id="308">You are quite possibly one of the worst pilots I have ever had the misfortune to come across. What took you so long? The original payment I had intended to make to you has been cancelled, but since you made it to the $THERE$, I will still pay you a token sum of $REWARD$ . Now go get your engines serviced!</t>
 <t id="309">Okay, I've had just about enough of this! You are possibly one of the worst transport pilots I have ever had the misfortune to come across. Where did you learn to fly? With the Split!? Do you even know where the $THERE$ is!? Your reward of $REWARD$ isn't going anywhere near your account, pilot!</t>
 <t id="310">Sorry pilot, I can't accept as you need a $SHIPTYPE$ craft to help us here. Try again once you have a new ship as we always need some help</t>
 <t id="312">It seems that the owners of the $THERE$ in $THERESECTOR$ don't seem to like you or trust you as much as we do. We're going to have to deny your request to transport the $WARES$, - you just wouldn't be able to get the freight anywhere near the $THERE$, let alone dock. Thanks for your interest though, we'll be in touch when your reputation isn't so hot. </t>
 <t id="313">This is incredible! What do you think you are playing at, pilot? Did you think you could fool us that easily? We have just received a cargo manifest report from the $THERE$, they are far from happy. Apparently you have only delivered $PLAYERSAMOUNT$ of the original $AMOUNT$ units of $WARES$ that we asked you to deliver! This is unacceptable. We had a contractual agreement with you that stated you would be paid $REWARD$ for this shipment, instead we have our company name dragged through back-sector nebulae and our business reputation ruined. Payment has been cancelled, we have logged your ship and id with local authorities who will no doubt ensure that your reputation for being a thief is made very public. </t>
 <t id="400">Q193_NORMAL_MISSION - Artefacts</t>
 <t id="401">[title]Newly-discovered Artefacts. $SHIPTYPE$ craft required.[/title]\n\n[justify]We are looking for a $TRADERANK$ or higher pilot to help us. Earlier this wozura, a stranger delivered $AMOUNT$ unknown Artefacts to us at $HERE$. They seem to be extremely rare and valuable. However, we simply do not have atmospheric conditioners here that have the efficiency to keep them stable, they are already starting to break up. We need someone with a $SHIPTYPE$ ship to urgently courier these Artefacts over to $THERE$ in $THERESECTOR$. They will be able to stabilize the Artefacts there. We will pay $REWARD$ for successful delivery, and if delivered within $TIMELIMIT$ then we may raise your payment with an extra $BONUSREWARD$. It should be evident that these Artefacts are extremely important to us and we believe they could tell us something about our history.\n\nOnly pilots who are confident of success should accept this mission - we wouldn't want to let these Artefacts be destroyed so soon after receiving them. If you really think that you are a pilot capable of meeting the challenge, then sign here to accept. Boron pilots please note that you are permitted to use your own ink when signing.[/justify]</t>
 <t id="402">I thought $SHIPTYPE$ class ships were faster than this? Hurry up!</t>
 <t id="404">Incoming Comms from $AUTHOR$ of the $HERE$ in $THISSECTOR$. : Contract Terminated. Pilot, we have received confirmation from the $THERE$ in $THERESECTOR$ that you have shown conduct unbecoming of a pilot of your calibre and skill. While we cannot clarify what this entails, it apparently has been enough for the Station Manager of the $THERE$ to revoke all docking privileges not just for you, but for all ships that ship $WARES$ from our $HERE$. You have disgraced our good name and put our business in serious jeopardy. Your payment of $REWARD$ has been revoked. If you think you're going to find work in this sector again, you are sadly mistaken. </t>
 <t id="405">Pilot, please get to $THERE$ in $THERESECTOR$ as fast as possible, The $TIMELIMIT$ was perhaps a little tight for time, so get that ship of yours moving.</t>
 <t id="407">That's great, you've arrived on schedule. You will find I have transferred $REWARD$ to your account as per our agreement. I wish you well in your travels.</t>
 <t id="408">I cannot believe you have the gall to call yourself a pilot! Your payment agreement has been altered, you will now find a sum of $REWARD$ in your account. At this time your skills at navigation do not merit any more than this. Spend more time in the simulators and less time in the bar!</t>
 <t id="409">I can't believe it, you are still not at the $THERE$. If this is what you call transporting cargo, then I hate to think what you do to your passengers! I don't care what you do or where you go as long as you stay away from $HERE$ in the future! I'm taking my payment of $REWARD$ that I was going to give to you, it'll be paid to a pilot who actually knows where he's going! Goodbye!</t>
 <t id="410">Since when did you own a $SHIPTYPE$ class craft? Try again once you can afford the proper equipment.</t>

If you feel you can engage in this venture with competence, please mark down your interest.\n\nPayment will be made to the sum of $REWARD$. If you are able to ship the cargo at a faster rate, payment will be raised up to another $BONUSREWARD$.

Currently there are $AMOUNT$ units of Luxury Foodstuffs for urgent delivery to $THERE$ in $THERESECTOR$. This is a time critical mission as applicants have only $TIMELIMIT$ to deliver the cargo. Once it has been placed in your $SHIPTYPE$ class ship, it will soon start to degrade. You must deliver within $TIMELIMIT$ to get your reward of $REWARD$. Swift shipment of the cargo will provide you with an extra $BONUSREWARD$.\n\nEntrance to the party is strictly prohibited. Deliver the goods and depart the station immediately. Consumption of the cargo will result in your failure of the mission and any rewards presented in this mission being revoked.\n\n[/justify]</t>

Our station $THERE$ in $THERESECTOR$ has confirmed they have errors in their inventory system. Supplies of biological Argnu Fertilizer are now 2 wozuras out-of-date. This issue must be resolved immediately. In this station $HERE$ there are $AMOUNT$ containers of Artificial Fertilizer that are viable and available for use. This must be shipped to $THERE$ for use before new stock arrives. Pilots who have a $SHIPTYPE$ vessel and a ranking of at least $TRADERANK$ are requested to assist in the shipment of this stock.\n\nThere is a station inspection due in $TIMELIMIT$ so acceptance of the mission means the Fertilizer must be delivered there before then. For this mission the pay is $REWARD$ on delivery, and if docked within $TIMELIMIT$ up to $BONUSREWARD$ may be payable. Upon successful delivery, your ship's hold will be fully cleaned to prevent any form of contamination.[/justify]</t>

Time is currently a mission-critical element for this task. Communications from the $THERE$ in $THERESECTOR$ have confirmed the receipt of a shipment of upgraded Hand Weapons. Older models were subsequently destroyed and shipped for reclamation. Unfortunately we are now aware of a design fault within the new shipment that has caused critical malfunctions. Due to the nature of this issue, it is of the utmost importance that this information be placed in the hands of a trusted and secure source.\n\nWe therefore need you to get $AMOUNT$ units of Hand Weapons over there within $TIMELIMIT$. You vessel must be of class $SHIPTYPE$. Payment will be presented to the sum of $REWARD$ upon completion. Prompt delivery will receive up to an additional $BONUSREWARD$. The sums involved in this matter cover the cost of your secrecy and the critical nature of this mission. Should you fail, this may escalate into a conflict capable of throwing the entire sector into disarray. Your success will prove your ability to undertake future work for our Company.[/justify]</t>

Sabotage is suspected, with many ships now urgently requiring repair. We just happen to have some Engine Components, in fact we have $AMOUNT$ of them that need to be shipped as soon as possible, ideally within $TIMELIMIT$.\n\nA payment of $REWARD$ will be made for the shipment of these Engine Components. Swift couriers will receive up to an additional $BONUSREWARD$, with an added possibility of perhaps being able to enter the Argon 1000 rally as a wildcard entry.

Many visitors have complained that they can clearly see condensation pouring down the walls.\n\nFortunately we have discovered that $THERE$ in $THERESECTOR$ is currently facing shortages in Water. They have urgently requested $AMOUNT$ canisters delivered to them. Pilots who have a $SHIPTYPE$ class vessel are requested to deliver this water there in return for a payment of $REWARD$. Shipment within $TIMELIMIT$ will enable a possible payment of up to $BONUSREWARD$ extra to be made. A minimum rank of $TRADERANK$ is required.

The station has asked for them to arrive within $TIMELIMIT$ in order that disruption to the facilities are minimized. Pilots will need a $SHIPTYPE$ vessel to complete this mission.\n\nPayment is $REWARD$ upon delivery, with an added payment of $BONUSREWARD$ being made if you arrive well within $TIMELIMIT$.

The $THERE$ in $THERESECTOR$ has suffered damage to an unshielded part of the station hull. The damage is enough to cause serious danger of a hull breach which would result in the destruction of several decks in that area. Station crew estimate that $AMOUNT$ units of Teladianium Panelling will be required to fix the damage.\n\nYour ship will have to be a $SHIPTYPE$ class in order to transport these panels from this station. Station Crew have confirmed that the hull will hold for $TIMELIMIT$ so you have that long to deliver the goods. Delivery on schedule will enable payment of $REWARD$ to be made.

We are now in the process of clearing the waste. The material has been sealed up into $AMOUNT$ units that will need a $SHIPTYPE$ ship to move it - fortunately the cargo is now stable.\n\nInspection of the facilities are due shortly so all waste units must be shipped to $THERE$ in $THERESECTOR$ for processing.

They have to be delivered to the $THERE$ in $THERESECTOR$. Time is really important here - because of the previous pilot's timely demise there has been a gap in the supply chain and narcotics customers seem to be very fussy about running out of stock. Must be something to do with the addiction. Anyway, you'll have $TIMELIMIT$ to get the Narcotics over there, and you'll be paid $REWARD$ for getting it there in time...and what the hell, if you can impress me with your speed of delivery I might give up to $BONUSREWARD$ as well. As I said, pilots must not sample the goods themselves unless you wish to conduct negotiations with a laser blaster in the future.

Infact it turns out that they can't handle all those slaves on their own and they need to upgrade their equipment pretty fast. The slaves and their owner are hiding out in the $THERE$ in $THERESECTOR$ and need me to supply them with $AMOUNT$ units of Super Slave Chips. This will solve all their problems.\n\nTrouble is, they can't keep the slaves a secret for much longer. When the others find out, they are sure a small war will break out as everyone is desperate for drone workers at the moment. Once they have the Super Slave Chips though, they can ship them out no problem. Because of this, they will need those chips within $TIMELIMIT$. Get them there on time, and you will be paid $REWARD$. Get them there earlier and you could get up to $BONUSREWARD$ more. The Pilot will need a craft of $SHIPTYPE$ or higher.\n\nWe have tried in the past to disguise our Super Slave Chips as Entertainment Chips so that passing military will not see anything illegal when they scan you.

 <t id="40204">What's going on Pilot? I've got reports that you are doing bad things for your reputation with $THERE$ in $THERESECTOR$. They will no longer allow you to dock with their station!. Well all you can do is drop the $WARES$ to another station, that way I can get someone to pick them up. I hope not all pilots are like you.</t>
 <t id="40205">Awesome, now move it if you want to be in $THERESECTOR$ in $TIMELIMIT$. $THERE$ are waiting for the $WARES$, so please hurry.</t>
 <t id="40207">Seems that the $WARES$ were in for quite a ride, they are saying that you had refreshments for them for the trip, good job Pilot, here's the $REWARD$ we agreed on.</t>
 <t id="40208">I've heard the $WARES$ are quite stressed, and no wonder. They must have been wondering if you were ever going to drop them off at $THERE$ at all. $REWARD$ is all you are getting, now get in your ship and go somewhere else.</t>
 <t id="40209">Excuse me, shouldn't you have got the $WARES$ to the $THERE$ in $THERESECTOR$ by now? I would like them to be dropped off at the next Station, so I can organize faster onward travel. As you have not completed your part of the bargain I will retain the fee.</t>
 <t id="40211">Seems your ship is pretty much full, I'm sorry but people actually need space to move around. I will wait for someone else to accept this offer</t>
 <t id="40214">Passengers Disembarked. Thank you. $AMOUNT$ $WARES$ have been unloaded from your ship. You may process any transactions as normal with the station, or depart at your discretion. </t>
 <t id="40309">That's incredible, are you sure your engines are actually working? That throttle control does actually move forward if you hadn't guessed! The time to get the $WARES$ to the $THERE$ has expired. We need to find a pilot who is capable of making good time and completing the mission. Please drop off the $WARES$ at the nearest station for pickup by courier. </t>
 <t id="40314">Thank you for docking. $AMOUNT$ $WARES$ have been unloaded from your ship. You are free to continue your journey. </t>
 <t id="40409">It appears that you have as much skill in navigating the sectors as a drunken Goner. The time allowed to deliver the $WARES$ to the $THERE$ has ended. We need to retrieve them from your ship in order to pass them on to a more competent pilot. Please drop the $WARES$ off at the next station you dock with!</t>
 <t id="40414">$AMOUNT$ $WARES$ have been unloaded from your ship. Thank you for docking. You may proceed to Hangar Bay IV for maintenance or depart at your discretion.</t>
 <t id="40509">I'm afraid the time given to deliver the $WARES$ to the $THERE$ is over. You are by far the worst pilot we have had the misfortune of employing. Why didn't you tell us you didn't know how to fly!? Please drop the $WARES$ off at the nearest station in order for us to pass them over to a more competent pilot. </t>
 <t id="60000">Q193_PIRATE_PASSENGER_MISSION - Passenger</t>
 <t id="60001">[title]Pirate Shipments Required[/title]\n\n[justify]Pilots who are willing to refrain from asking questions are required urgently. The journey will involve the shipment of $AMOUNT$ $WARES$ from $HERE$ to the $THERE$ in $THERESECTOR$ as fast as possible. Pilots must show a minimum rank of $TRADERANK$. Anything less and requests for authorization will be dropped like an empty spacefuel canister. Also a ship of $SHIPTYPE$ class is required and the deadline for the destination is $TIMELIMIT$. Pilots who can make it there in time will be paid $REWARD$, those able to make it there sooner may deserve more, if so an additional $BONUSREWARD$ will be added on top. That is all. Those able to take up this offer, get moving to the hangar bay.[/justify]</t>
 <t id="60002">Get to $THERE$ in $THERESECTOR$ at top speed. No sightseeing! You have $TIMELIMIT$ left, don't waste it.</t>
 <t id="60004">If you think you're going to dock at the $THERE$ in $THERESECTOR$, you've got another thing coming. They don't like you as much as you might have thought, in fact it looks like they don't like you at all. Whatever you've been doing has been enough for them to revoke all docking and trade privileges. Drop the $WARES$ off at the nearest station, we may be able to get some close to your position to pick them up. You're on your own now, forget any payment you were hoping to receive. You're not worthy of the $REWARD$ we offered. Mission aborted. </t>
 <t id="60005">You have been confirmed as authorized to enter into this mission. Your records confirm you have no established links with law enforcement units in the local sectors. Information relating to the requirements of the mission will be uploaded into your ships log shortly should you wish to refer to it in the future. Transport $AMOUNT$ $WARES$ from $HERE$ to the $THERE$ in $THERESECTOR$ as fast as possible. The deadline for reaching the destination is $TIMELIMIT$. Pilots who can make it there in time will be paid $REWARD$, those able to make it there a lot faster than the $TIMELIMIT$ may get the additional $BONUSREWARD$. </t>
 <t id="60008">You fly like a Goner Priest. When I accepted you as the transport pilot for the $WARES$, I was either under the influence of spacefuel, or just under the impression that you actually knew how to fly. Still, you made it to the $THERE$, how I do not know, so I'm going to pay you $REWARD$ for your trouble. If you think I'm going to give you this kind of mission again, you're going to be waiting a long long time. Go back flight school pilot, you have a long way to go before you can call yourself competent!</t>
 <t id="60100">Q193_PIRATE_PASSENGER_MISSION - Very Important Passenger</t>
 <t id="60101">[title]Clan Leader Needs Transport![/title]\n\n[justify]A pilot with good standing amongst the Pirate leadership is required, someone who also has the ability to keep his mouth shut and his ears closed. No reason or explanation will be given for posting this contract at this time. All that is required is a fast ship of $SHIPTYPE$ class and a pilot who knows how to get both the passenger and any bodyguards, females etc from $HERE$ to the $THERE$ in $THERESECTOR$. Pilot rank must be a minimum of $TRADERANK$, anything less will not be accepted. Failure to complete this mission on deadline will be taken very seriously. There is a maximum of $TIMELIMIT$ to make it to the $THERE$. The total amount of people including the clan leader will be $AMOUNT$ so make sure no one is left behind. Get there in time and payment of $REWARD$ will be made. Make it there sooner, and an additional sum of $BONUSREWARD$ will enter your account. Success will also ensure Pilots will be marked down for future work. That is all. After a security check, please meet in the hangar bay immediately.[/justify]</t>
 <t id="60104">Okay. Our clients at the $THERE$ in $THERESECTOR$ aren't too happy with something you did recently, they won't take you on board. I hope whatever it was made you lots of money because you aren't getting any from us!! Get the $WARES$ to a station and we will pick them up. Kill them and I promise, you will regret it.</t>

I am nothing more than a simple $ARACEN$ station owner, but I come to you in the hope that you may be my one last chance. A $VRACEN$ Cartel has notified me that they hold my dearest partner $AUTHOR$ hostage far from here. Their leader, $VICTIM$, has threatened to kill her if I notify Police forces, or do not surrender a sum of 25,000,000 credits to them. All I have is this one factory, I barely make enough to keep our transports active, I fear that when they hear I neither have the money or ability to pay, they will dispose of her without thought. I see the weaponry you carry around you and the state of your ship, my feelings are that you perhaps may be the one who could save my beloved from this terrible fate.\n\nPlease, you must go to $VSECST$, the Cartel have left her at a station in $VSECFN$ and are patrolling the sectors between those points, you should find $VICTIM$ in that region. If you can neutralise him, I will be able to make contact with her and use this station's defence force to deal with any threat on the station. I will pay you what little money I have, the sum of $REWARD$ credits if you can get me to $VSECFN$ in time to save my partner. Will you assist me in this endeavour?[/justify]\n\n[center][select value='start']Contact $AUTHOR$[/select][/center][/text]</t>
 <t id="5003">[author]$AUTHOR$[/author][text cols='1'][justify]You have saved not only my partner's life, but the future of our family. My dearest is pregnant with our firstborn.

I'm going to start you off with a few suggestions on where you may find some $WARES$. Actually there's quite a few, here's some from the list we have,</t>
 <t id="6">When did you last check your ship? You need at least freight size $TKCLASS$ to accept this mission. Stop wasting our time</t>
 <t id="7">Excellent! You've brought back some $WARES$ to our $HERE$. The total you have accumulated so far is $REWARDSOFAR$ for the $WARESSOFAR$ units you've managed to ship up to now. Remember that there is still $TIMELEFT$ for you to obtain more of the goods we require. </t>
 <t id="8">I see that you've been having some problems... Haven't found any of the wares we require yet? Well, you still have $TIMELEFT$ to get us the full amount of $WARES$. If you manage to get them all, we will be happy to supply you with the extra payment of $BONUSREWARD$. </t>
 <t id="9">Well it looks like you're out of time! We can't accept any more wares from you. You managed to ship a total of $WARESSOFAR$ $WARES$ to us! Your total payment for what you delivered to us was $REWARDSOFAR$. Thanks for helping us out pilot. Goodbye!</t>
 <t id="10">Well, that's something we've never seen before. You've actually managed to get none of the $WARES$ that we asked you to ship back to our $HERE$. You have to be one of the worst haulage pilots we have ever employed. I'm sorry but since you didn't provide us with anything, we're not willing to provide you with any payment. Seems that the promise of $BONUSREWARD$ on getting all the $WARES$ didn't affect your motivation one little bit. Go Away, I'm telling all the factories around here how bad you are!!</t>
 <t id="11">Okay, it looks like you have been authorized to proceed with this mission. Given that you may have some trouble remembering all the details given to you, I'm going to run through them here. We're the $HERE$ and we're located in $THISSECTOR$. We need a total of $AMOUNT$ $WARES$ in less than $TIMELIMIT$. Payment will be $UNITPRICE$ per unit. All wares delivered gets an additional $BONUSREWARD$ on top.

 <t id="12">Okay, it looks like we have you authorized to proceed. Given that you may forget, we're going to remind you that we're the $HERE$ located in $THISSECTOR$. We're looking for a total of $AMOUNT$ $WARES$. We need you to get them in less than $TIMELIMIT$. Payment will be $UNITPRICE$ per unit. I don't think you will have too much problem in keeping this in mind, but if you do forget, you can always look it up in your system log. I'm sorry but there are no stations nearby, that's why I have given such a high payment for the wares and the incentive of a generous $BONUSREWARD$ if you can get all of it.</t>

 <t id="101">[Title]Factory Failure Creates Opening for Additional Trade Run[/title]\n\n[justify]Greetings to all. One of our main competitors has been hit by disaster as all its transport pilots have suddenly taken industrial action and walked out on strike. Being low on resources, they will be unable to supply all their customers, who will be forced to come to us. So here at the $HERE$ we need to quickly build up our stocks and to do so we need at least another $AMOUNT$ $WARES$. However all our own pilots are busy, which means we have an opening for a pilot. The applicant for this mission has only $TIMELIMIT$ to get all $AMOUNT$ units of $WARES$ back to us here. In return we will reimburse $UNITPRICE$ per unit, in addition to that the willing pilot must be in a ship that can take $TKCLASS$ sized cargo and hold at least a standing of $TRADERANK$. We are working on a tight schedule as we have made clear, so if all the $WARES$ are delivered within $TIMELIMIT$ then up to an additional $BONUSREWARD$ will be paid.[/justify] </t>
 <t id="102">$TIMELEFT$ remaining. We're counting on you to get the $WARES$ to us so please don't let us down.</t>
 <t id="103">What!? Are you done already? It seems that we now have all of the $WARES$ that we requested to be shipped to this $HERE$. Good work! You were quick to get the $AMOUNT$ $WARES$. Total standard payment you got for all the wares was $REWARDSOFAR$. We are more than happy to pay you the $BONUSREWARD$ that was promised on top, both payments have now been transferred. If you ever need more work in $THISSECTOR$, you know where to find us. </t>
 <t id="104">It looks like something's happened to make you distinctly unpopular in $THISSECTOR$. You can no longer dock at the station to complete your shipment of the $AMOUNT$ units of $WARES$. While we're not going to start interrogating you about your actions, we are going to drop you from our books like a hot cahoona. You're going to have to look elsewhere for work with a station that doesn't have any concerns about your actions. </t>
 <t id="105">Great, we have your details confirmed as a registered pilot we can trust, so you have the green light on this mission. Here's a heads-up on the mission again. We need a total of $AMOUNT$ $WARES$ delivered to the $HERE$ located in $THISSECTOR$. $UNITPRICE$ is what you will get per ware taken from your ship. You need to ship the last batch of cargo to us in less than $TIMELIMIT$. $BONUSREWARD$ on delivery of all goods. As for suggestions on where to go? I'm surprised you've asked, considering you have a ranking as high as $TRADERANK$. Anyway, there are quite a few stations you could go to for $WARES$. Here are some from the list we have,</t>
 <t id="106">Get lost - can't you read or is your translator broken? Your ship needs to be able to carry $TKCLASS$ freight at least to perform this mission</t>
 <t id="107">Great work pilot! We now have some $WARES$ in our hangar bay. The amount you have accumulated so far is $REWARDSOFAR$ for the $WARESSOFAR$ units you've managed to ship to us up to now. Just to remind you, there is still $TIMELEFT$ for you to get more of the goods we need back to our $HERE$. </t>
 <t id="108">Well it looks like you haven't been able to get any of the wares we need yet. Is there a problem with your navigation software? Well you still have $TIMELEFT$ to bring us the full amount of $WARES$. Remember if you are able to get them all, we will be able to pay you an additional $BONUSREWARD$. </t>
 <t id="109">I'm sorry but it appears that the deadline for shipping wares to our $HERE$ has ended. You have clocked up a total of $REWARDSOFAR$ for the $WARESSOFAR$ $WARES$ we received. Thanks for all your help pilot. Goodbye!</t>
 <t id="110">I don't believe it, you couldn't even get one shipment of $WARES$ back to our $HERE$. What were you doing? Catching spaceflies? Next time we urgently need resources to continue production, we'll hire someone who knows what they're doing. We'll be promising the sum of $BONUSREWARD$ for that pilot to complete the shipments instead. As for you, perhaps you ought to take up another line of work, ferrying passengers for example, if you can get there on time..</t>

 <t id="205">Thanks for waiting, I have checked your details and you appear to be a pilot who can fulfil our requirements. I'm going to run down the details of the mission again.

You need to get the last batch of cargo to us in less than $TIMELIMIT$ to get the extra payment of $BONUSREWARD$.

The total payment you have accumulated so far is $REWARDSOFAR$ for the $WARESSOFAR$ units you've managed to ship to us. Remember, there is still $TIMELEFT$ for you to get more of the goods we require back to our $HERE$. Things are looking good pilot!</t>

 <t id="209">Okay, that's your time up pilot. We can't accept any more wares from you. You did however manage to ship a total of $WARESSOFAR$ $WARES$ to us! And your total for that amount was $REWARDSOFAR$. Thanks for helping us keep our $HERE$ open! Goodbye!</t>
 <t id="210">Incredible! Your ship is empty and so are our hangar bays. We asked you to get $WARES$ shipped to our factory before our production cycle came to a halt, but you couldn't even manage to find a factory to dock at!

 <t id="310">The deadline has expired, and our hangars are still empty. You have failed in a way that would be quite impressive if it wasn't so costly to this $HERE$. We are still in a state of shock at the fact that you were unable to locate even one factory that could offer us our $WARES$. Still, we shall find someone who has a working knowledge of $THISSECTOR$.

"It was incredible" said Ta Shee-Do enthusiast Michael Kormach, "Most of the time it was just two blurs going at it in the centre but despite the fact that I was tired, hungry, and desperately needed to relieve myself I couldn't tear my eyes away from the ring. Just crazy."\n\nThe controversial competition, which has been running for five jazuras now, pits a maximum of two fighters per race against each other in a series of sudden death rounds until a Galactic Champion and Runner Up are determined. Winner is determined by knockout or submission and the final cash prize is substantial. Shin Zein was not available for comment but we were able to speak to a spokesperson for Nathan who claimed, "I have talked to Mr Gunner this morning - he is in good spirits and expects to resume training for the next tournament as soon as he is able to. This is provided that the spine reconstruction surgery goes as planned." he added.\n\nSpec Harley - Sports Correspondent, Galnet[/justify][/text]</t>

All 5 nations \(Argon Boron Teladi Split Paranid\) enter a basic-level ship which has been stripped down to a standard chassis and driven by solar-sail propulsion. A route is chosen to pass through a number of planetary sectors, normally pirate-free. Pirates even keep clear of the race as it draws too much attention to their activities.\n\nSolar sailing, once popular in early space travel is now the sport of Kings and Governments. The winner of the last tournament were the Boron, who are hosting this jazura's event.

Apart from the distances involved, the goods themselves are increasingly at greater risk from pirates who are rumoured to be hired by rival factory owners to attack transport ships. Ships that do get through however, bring large profits to their owners. It may be worth investing in some support craft, or purchasing additional weaponry. The profits you gain in success will more than pay for such small investments.\n\nNili Ma - Galaxy Network - GalNet[/justify][/text]</t>

 <t id="6">[article/][author]{1294,80}[/author][title]"What's With These Pirates?; Miner shows 'concern'"[/title][text cols='2'][justify]Take a "space-walk" in any ship and you're bound to come across space pirates . They fly around as if their activity is legit- slowly and conspicuously. Such bold activity should make anyone wonder why and how they could do such with "all" the police and government around, which in-turn makes them think of how much police and government vehicles are actually in use.\n\nA miner who just came from a day-shift in asteroid-laden, and also home to a pirate base, Ore-Belt questioned an officer as to why there is the base around yet no assaults against it. The officer was "too busy" attending to the shiny new hull of his M6 in his dreams to answer the question. The miner, frustrated at such a lax attitude for the harsh terrain of space made sure he was up by sending a sound pulse to his ship via a squash mine. The miner was spared from imprisonment as he hadn't harmed him, but now he's been put on surveillance for any dangerous activity.\n\nPil Mino - Galaxy Network[/justify][/text]</t>

After checking the Navcharts the Captain noticed he was on a collision course with the South Gate in Aladna Hill. The navigator's quarters were later searched and two bottles of Argon whisky was found along with some spaceweed.\n\nIt is said the Navigator, an ex Goner, had spiritual conflicts. "He will be placed in hospital for rehabilitation as soon as we dock at the shipyard," said the Captain.\n\nJanit Brena - Galaxy News[/justify][/text]</t>
 <t id="8">[article/][author]{1294,80}[/author][title]Galnet Special : Weapons At War - Phased Shockwave Generator[/title][text cols='1'][justify]"Phased Shockwave Generator"\nJan Polak\n\nThis weapon was developed by a rare alliance between the Teladi and Paranid. It works by sending out a phased package, which reacts and expands, creating a shockwave. This weapon has many uses; one is missile defence, and another is multiple fighter defence. The weapon is quite unique in that it is the first 'area affect' weapon to come out on the open market. The Paranid decided to sell this in attempt to boost their poor economy, and it has proven quite a success since its release. The process of building this weapon is a complicated one that requires special machinery.\n\nSafety is also an issue; the prototype station exploded when the main matter-compressor overloaded. Since the incident, the manufacturing process has been adapted with machines taking over most of the dangerous phases of production. The Phased packages are developed in a vacuum at zero gravity. If the package reacts with photon energy - more commonly known as light - the package will start to expand. Another requirement therefore is a that the manufacturing process takes place entirely in the dark.\n\nThe energy is then compressed using subspace compression technology, similar to that used within cargo bays. When it expands the energy sends out phased waves that affect both the shields and hull of a vessel. Some pilots have described its effects as, 'Being stuck in an Ion Storm'.[/justify][/text]</t>
 <t id="9">[article/][author]{1294,80}[/author][title]Galnet Special : Weapons At War - Ion Disruptor[/title][text cols='1'][justify]"Ion Disruptor"\nJan Polak\n\nDeveloped by Boron Scientists this weapon is unlike any weapon encountered. The Ion Disruptor fires a steady stream of ion particles in the direction of a ship. The stream is then ignited. The result is a lightning effect that affects ship systems and shields, whilst leaving the hull relatively untouched.\n\nAlthough this weapon is new, it has undergone extensive testing to make sure it keeps to high Boron standards. Although simple enough to explain how it works, manufacturing the weapon is different matter. It is a complicated process that involves building a device that can create a stream of ionised particles. This in itself is dangerous. The process can be seen in one of the Borons Published Documents by Dr Halilo Wo - "Processes and Functions of the Ion"[/justify][/text]</t>
 <t id="10">[article/][author]{1294,80}[/author][title]Galnet Special : Weapons At War - The Mass Driver[/title][text cols='1'][justify]"The Mass Driver"\nJan Polak\n\nThis weapon is unique in that it is the only type of non-energy based projectile weapon available. It consists of a rapid feed multi-barrelled cannon that is capable of delivering a large number of small projectiles to its target in a short period of time.\n\nIt inflicts damage not due to the power of individual projectiles but through the large numbers of projectiles delivered. Due to the nature of this weapons ammunition it has almost no effect on a ships shield but instead delivers heavy damage directly to the target's hull. It also causes very little power drain because all energy requirements are supplied by the ammunition.\n\nCurrently the weapon can only be fitted to Argon and Split ships. The true power of this weapon comes from its ammunition. Each projectile is a self contained unit consisting of the projectile itself, a small armour piercing shell with a micro explosive core encased in a unique crystalline matrix, which allows the shells to pass through ship shields unhindered. This is possible by producing a tiny spatial distortion using the shields own energy, and an explosive micro-charge designed to propel the shell at high velocity towards its target. This pack contains 200 rounds.[/justify][/text]</t>
 <t id="11">[article/][author]{1294,80}[/author][title]Riots in Priests Pity.[/title][text cols='2'][justify]Demonstrating Paranids, angry at the "Sacred Relic of Hope" being moved from Priest's Pity to Trinity Sanctum, exploded into violence when Paranid Police forces moved in to restore order to the area. Police forces were driven back by over 13,000 protestors as the scene developed into chaos.\n\nThe protestors later took over the police station and held the police forces captive in their own interrogation cells. Emperor Xaar gave orders to send in the 191st Paranid Army Division to quell the angry mob. Camera teams were forced out of the area as the army brought order back to the area. They have been no official reports of casualties and information of exactly how the situation is still unknown and probably always will be.\n\nJanit Brano - Galaxy News[/justify][/text]</t>
 <t id="12">[article/][author]{1294,80}[/author][title]Galnet Special : Weapons At War - Photon Pulse Cannons[/title][text cols='1'][justify]"Photon Pulse Cannons"\nJan Polak\n\nFirst Developed by Professor Jo Bydnah of the Argon, the Photon Pulse Cannon is a firm favourite of the Argon Military, who then sold the original designs on to other races. This type of weapon is extremely powerful, and can only be fitted on the larger Capital craft. It works by sending highly charged photon radiation through a series of coils that multiplies the charge, creating a very deadly pulse of radiation. The more powerful version of this weapon include a super-conducting coilset and a proton filter that makes the weapon more effective against hull and shields.\n\nThe stations that produce them were the original Weapons Research Laboratories that developed this technology for the Argon. Professor Bydnah still works on updating the PPC weapon and has recently become the head of Argon Weapons Research in Omicron Lyrae, representing the Grand Sonra University.[/justify][/text]</t>
 <t id="13">[article/][author]{1294,80}[/author][title]Thousands dead as asteroid pushed into planet[/title][text cols='2'][justify]The planet Oceania in Menelaus' Paradise is in a state of shock after an asteroid hit by a TL class transporter was sent tumbling into the planet's atmosphere. The death toll is currently unknown but is thought to number well over 12,000. The gigantic transporter was attempting to set up a silicon mine on a nearby asteroid and nudged the mountain sized rock onto a collision course. The Boron pilot, Fumi No, was tested for narcotics and was found to be under the influence of both spaceweed and Argon whisky. If found guilty of flying while intoxicated, Fumi No faces a prison sentence of no less than 8 Jazura and his Master's licence revoked.

 <t id="14">[article/][author]{1294,80}[/author][title]Competing pirate groups cause havoc in frontier sectors[/title][text cols='2'][justify]Reports have been coming in about rival pirate groups setting up competitions between themselves. The recent spate of thefts, ship hijackings, and smuggling incidents have led to major police investigations which have revealed that the pirate groups are ranking themselves in a league table format. This league table seems to be split into two sections. The first of these sections involves speed records for various activities including the top times for completing gate races, quickest ship hijacking and fastest escape from police attention. The other section relates to the amount of credits gained from certain activities. Examples include the highest price for a single smuggling run of contraband products or the highest price for the sale of a stolen ship.\n\nA copy of the "high credits" section of the leader board was recently obtained by Argon military forces in a raid on the pirate base in the sector Ore Belt. The list was a major find and has been used in bringing over 20 pirates to justice. More of the criminals are still being hunted but the Argon are confident that when they are found, the criminals will be convicted by the compelling evidence against them. Tomes Burnett, a spokesperson for the Argon military said "These criminals must be stopped. Not only are they breaking the law, they are making a game out of it. It is a blatant insult to law enforcers of every race as well as to all law abiding citizens throughout the known systems. This cannot and will not be tolerated." He then went on to remind all individuals that financial rewards are offered to any sentient being who helps to reduce the pirate problem, provided that they are in possession of a police licence.\n\nKunklu Ni - Legal Correspondent, Galnet News[/justify][/text]</t>

The first of its class were developed when the Paranid and Argon were friends and both governments were focused on developing a weapon more powerful than those they currently had in service.\n\nA particle accelerator was entered into the standard laser to try to increase the speed of the weapon's output. The results were amazing an almost 200% increase in output. The PAC was born. The particles are accelerated to two thirds the speed of light. At that point they are then polarised and focused into a tight energy pulse.\n\nThe effect can be quite devastating, especially to a target ship's hull. A direct hit has been known to actually dent hull plating.\nOver the jazuras, the PAC has evolved into three types, the Alpha, Beta and Gamma. Each one has a slight modification to the polarisation and focusing of the particles.[/justify][/text]</t>

The radiation is so dangerous that the weapon had to go through many jazuras of research and development until it could be placed on the open market.\nA major drawback of earlier models being when the weapon was fired a large build-up of plasma remained in the weapons main firing zone. When firing a second time this plasma would ignite causing a large fireball, destroying the craft it was on.\n\nThis was originally resolved by adding a plasma sink into the weapons main design, purging the weapon of all excess plasma between shots. This technology was developed by a now famous Paranid Scientist, LarkElSung, however it has since been made obsolete.\nIn 420 an alternative was added to this weapon to replace the plasma sink, a Boron biological plasma filter. The regenerative properties of the Boron technology means that this filter never needs replacing.\n\nToday HEPT's as they are now known, are invaluable. They can only be used on larger fighters.

Even some of the new weaponry developments are being put into production in relatively widespread sectors. While all such facilities have their own security forces, there is a real danger that opportunistic raiders could attack in force and seize large quantities of very powerful missiles and energy cannons.\n\nWhile governments are unhappy at the situation, most say there is no alternative to dispersed production if efficient distribution of weapons is to be maintained. They also point to the need to ensure resources for their factories are within easy reach. Teladi Profit Guild official Etofomeos Ilalios Ulylues VIII said: "There is a need to balance practicality with security. Not to mention profit."

The penalties can be severe and slavers, in particular, should be warned that the Argon and Boron will not look kindly on their business.

In very early stages of development, this technology would link each ship to the DNA of its pilot. Upon ejection from the craft, the Goner vehicle would effectively shut-down. Cargo space would be uncompressed, rendering the ship useless for carrying cargo, and further engine tunings and rudder tunings would not be possible. A new reaction system would also eject vital parts of the ship out along with the pilot, such as shields and navigation systems, thus hopefully bringing the attack to the attention of the local law enforcement ships. Whilst not perfect, as the ship could still be captured and sold, the improvements are welcome.

Goner is a well-known name around the universe and is synonymous with our religious beliefs of R Gunn and our peaceful nature. Jako Halter claims to have found evidence that Goner could also mean someone whose fate is certain and is about to meet an untimely end. He goes on to suggest that this meaning actually fits quite nicely with the behaviour of the missionaries who are constantly attacked, murdered and captured without fighting back and sometimes without taking evasive action. Senior Goner sources are said to be concerned with this report as it may affect recruitment, and dismiss it as tabloid hysteria.\n\nJako Seldon - Current Affairs Correspondent, Galnet[/justify][/text]</t>

A smaller craft armed with 18 lasers and the then newly-developed 125MJ shields. It came into service during the Xenon Conflict replacing the Argon Century as the main battleship. The Century was later decommissioned as it was not powerful enough to cope with the demands of modern combat. The reign of the Titan continued for many jazuras until the Argon government took on a radical new design. Longer than the Mk-I Titan, the MK-II Titan reminded people of Boron submarine craft. The design of the ship took many people by surprise, it was not like any other ship design to date.\n\nThe Mk-III is the latest design. More advanced technologies were used when constructing this vessel, and the Titan Mk-III was born. Its original purpose was to be an explorer ship as new jumpgates were being found. But the Mk-II design was showing its age. The length of the ship meant it was hard to manoeuvre. Poor forward velocity also made this problem worse. The rate of turn was so bad that it earned a nickname of "Old Argnu" as it was said that it was easier to steer a cow.\n\nMk-III is much improved.

This account is believed to have been emptied and closed several tazuras ago. While a number of investors have been left with big losses from what now appears to have been a carefully orchestrated swindle, the biggest loser is Teladi amateur Roulestar champion Gradias Hilibis Trantaeos IV.\n\nIt is believed the ace gambler put the greater part of a 15 million credit fortune into the venture and that this has all been lost. The tragedy for Trantaeos is all the more poignant given that she recently tripled her fortune from 5 million credits after a remarkable run of luck in Teladi casinos. The mystery for some is why Trantaeos would invest her money in such a mundane venture as a mining operation. Some in Treasure Chest whisper that the Teladi was caught up in a variation on the old and well-known nividium asteroid scam. Trantaeos vehemently denies any such suggestion and has insisted that this is a case of simple financial malpractice.

All this is now threatened by massive flame-fronts extending over wide swathes of countryside.\n\nDisaster control authorities on the planet say that they simply do not have the resources to put the fires out and are concentrating on protecting settlements. It is hoped the fires will burn themselves out but the cost will be enormous. There is already talk of arson and sabotage with rumours of off-world visitors setting fires deliberately.

The location is highly classified, however rumour tells us that it is set up in close vicinity to Cloudbase South West, somewhere outside the main system area. Other rumours tells us also that the station has its own system drive, allowing it to fly freely in vicinity of the system. Officially no one has been confirmed having visited this station yet, quite probably because it is not marked on any maps. On the other hand even if anyone does manage to find it he probably will not be allowed to dock. A large number of laser turrets are armed to take out every ship approaching without permission.\n\nThe main goal of establishing this centre is to find weak points in jumpdrive construction and eliminate them, as well as to find new advantages that will improve the use of this drive. It could be, for example, a way to lower fuel cell consumption or even to jump without the use of energy cells. Another topic could be to improve the programming system which is used by the autopilot for setting the autojump sequence where there are no crew on board.

 <t id="11">[article/][author]{1294,20}[/author][title]Mysterious Attacks in the Boron Heartland[/title][text cols='2'][justify]Rumours are flying faster than Octopuses in the bars of Boron Space this week after mysterious attacks on shipping lanes at the very heart of Boron Space. A spate of attacks in and around Queen's Space is causing a lot of talk and even more nervousness amongst Boron traders.\n\nOnly one pilot, having survived the attacks, was too shaken to give a coherent report. The only words to have come from Hago Bli's mouth have been "like vicious wolves" and "never saw them coming". He was one of the pilots doing the standard Nostrop Oil run between CEO's Buckzoid and Kingdom End when their convoy was attacked. All the freighters and escorts, including five Boron Eels, were blown to so much space dust. Miraculously, the attackers did not spot Bli who seems to have ejected rather more quickly than his colleagues. No-one knows whether the other pilots were taken for slaves or brutally killed in space.\n\nTraditionally, the sectors close to Kingdom End have been relatively free of pirate and mercenary activity. Rumours point to a band of renegade pirates, possibly supported by one of the more warlike races. There are even those who suggest help from beyond known space, given the amazing effectiveness of these attacks. Pilots running these routes are warned to take extra care, and wingmen if they can afford them.\n\nBabu Di - Foreign Affairs Correspondent RCN News[/justify][/text]</t>

The total capacity of the ordered TL class ships is sufficient to supply several sectors needs at once raising the fear of a trade war. A mitigating factor is the delivery time required for each ship, but with shipyards working overtime to fulfil orders, and with more orders anticipated it is unclear what the outcome will be.\n\nAnother factor that is of concern to Boron traders is the fact that according to manufacturing logs, virtually all TL class ships have had maximum cargo capacity upgrades specified as standard. While it is commonplace for traders to work their way up to such capacity over a period of time, the immediate order of full capacity TL ships is causing even greater tension.\n\nBabu Di - Foreign Affairs Correspondent RCN News[/justify][/text]</t>

A trial of this magnitude would normally be held in Kingdom End however it is thought the Split in particular would prefer Haka Po's silence and the long journey was deemed impractical on security grounds.\n\nWhile the trial is to be held in the Sector Supreme Court, the panel of five judges will be drawn from the Royal Lords of Justice, the highest and most qualified judges in all Boron space. Security will remain high throughout and the trial is expected to take 2 jazuras at a minimum.\n\nMala La - Crime Correspondent RCN News [/justify][/text]</t>

The Paranid empire intended to extract 2% of all used asteroids in local sectors by the end of this fiscal jazura, however it appears that they have achieved this goal three mazuras early.\n\nThis news has caused the dramatic price rise in mining company stocks of an average 5 credits.

Paranid destroyers are notoriously fast and hard to control, but this still doesn't explain how the pilot managed to fly in a dead straight line for over twelve kilometres before impacting the station. Fortunately the collision was a glancing blow, resulting in only moderate damage and a few deaths. Paranid military sources report the pilot of the vessel has already been tried and convicted of "treason by default". He will be executed tomorrow but will not be given the normal death rites associated with Paranid culture; this is one of the worst punishments the Paranid can inflict on one of their own, and suggests the matter is more serious than it first appears.

The family of Taka Jo, a mineral survey worker, had given up hope that the faithful beast was alive only mazuras after the steam-vent eruptions on the planet of Great Trench Alpha.

In a tremendous feat of survival, stamina and unexplained animal sense, the faithful squidray had tracked down the family it had lost all those jazuras ago.

Pioneering technology in the area of stasis fields has allowed visitors to get up close and personal with some of the most feared Ghok of the last 10 jazura. For the token fee of 10 credits, visitors will be able to marvel at the beasts, some of which claimed the lives of our most well-known Deathmatchers, including that of Mo't Ktt. Older Split will remember Mo't Ktt as the first champion to better a Ghok armed only with a small knife. He cleverly broke off one of the Ghok's claws and used this as a weapon on his way to victory. Visitors will be able to see Mo't Ktt, or at least some of him, in the exhibition - if you look carefully at the large yellow and purple Ghok near the back of the museum, you will see one of his limbs in the mouth of the beast.\n\nYo't Kt, Culture Correspondent, SFN News[/justify][/text]</t>

Once docking has been approved, pilots should proceed in an orderly fashion to the nearest docking bay where their cargo can be loaded or unloaded. You are reminded that once inside any station, overtaking is strictly prohibited. Similarly, discharge of any weapons is also strictly prohibited.\n\nThis report is sadly necessary following a recent incident in a Solar Power Plant in Split space, where the station was desperately low on resources. Two Split traders were competing to get docked first and get the best price when they collided, both spinning out of control and exploding inside the station. Luckily, the shielding held and damage was minimal, however production within the Solar Power plant ground to a halt as it ran out of the necessary resource. If you must race for position, please do so outside the stations only.\n\nCho't Lt, Social Affairs Correspondent, SFN News[/justify][/text]</t>
 <t id="45">[article/][author]{1294,30}[/author][title]New Shield Tech saves Markus Spacefly[/title][text cols='2'][justify]In a move to play down their past abuse of the Markus Space Fly, the Split Central Research Corp has recently devised a new shielding system that prevents the delicate gossamer bodies of the SpaceFly from being damaged on contact with ship shields at any velocity. The technology allows shielding to actively detect the mass of an object coming into contact with the shield component system. If the mass computes to be similar to the mass of the SpaceFly, the shields will place a phased-buffer charge at the location of the contact, gently buffeting the SpaceFly away from the craft.\n\nThis technology has been tested with both static and mobile craft, with the possibility that factories and stations will also be incorporating this feature into future upgrades.\n\nWith final licensing agreements going into effect within the next mazura, Governments from all species and sectors are quietly looking forward to seeing the growth of the Markus population. Meanwhile Pirate factions are known to be watching this development closely with a view to adding the technology into illegal Markus traps spread across the known sectors.\n\nHa't Pst - Science Correspondent SFN News[/justify][/text]</t>

Mercenaries are reported to have struck in force as Fhee t'Rrrr was shuttled to the transport in a Scorpion class ship. The mercenaries were using very light fighters of an unknown type, probably a new pirate variant. Several were destroyed by sector defence forces but the speed and surprise of their attack allowed most to escape through the gate to Rhonkar's Clouds. All traces of the interlopers were lost at this point.\n\nFhee t'Rrrr was head of Family Chin computer components distribution and the motive for this craven and cowardly attack is uncertain at this time. With no prisoners and very little data to go on, the reason may never be ascertained. Nevertheless, Family Chin has posted a bounty of 1,000,000 credits for information leading to the arrest of the perpetrators or planners of this vile crime.\n\nAzoth tufts - Security Correspondent SFN News [/justify][/text]</t>

"Those Boron fools would not know how to synchronize an attack in the necessary fashion. I am happy that they concentrate and waste their energies on this device.

No professional gladiator has previously retired in the history of the sport. It has been a universal rule that professionals die in the arena.

For those of you that don't, this clever little planet-designed gadget was aimed at hot-headed Split everywhere. Being a mighty warrior and a little short tempered is not always a good combination! So the Nowhey was designed. Made from innovative flexible materials, it is about half the size of a Split and virtually indestructible. In a moment of rage, it can be stabbed, punched, kicked, bitten and even whipped against a bulkhead and it will not break. It was designed to let angry Split take out their vengeance and temper without hurting anyone or damaging anything. Sadly, the plan has backfired. It seems that most Split are even more furious at not being able to damage the Nowhey, and have started looking for the next best thing, notably each other. After a three fold increase in fatalities in the last wozura alone, the Nowhey has now been withdrawn from sale and all use of them banned in public places.

Contrary to popular belief, this is not a cowardly way for the Split to fight, but merely using the appropriate tactics for this situation - pilots were keen to emphasize this.\n\nThe attacks were made in a successful attempt to stem similar style raids by the Xenon into Split sectors. Whilst this will work over the short term, the ultimate goal is of course to destroy the Xenon Shipyard. No such attempt was made during this recent assault.

The fires on the Argon planet have devastated large portions of the forests of that world and there are believed to have been a number of deaths. The Argon government has made no direct accusation or even hinted at the involvement of any external power. Even so, sources in Nyana's Hideout have whispered that a "foreign power" was "jealous" of the fine and exotic woods of Nyana's Planet.

The planet, in independent Olmancketslat's Treaty sector, has long been settled by a variety of renegades and refugees from the space powers. Argon, Paranid, Split and Teladi individuals and families have established cities and independent statelets in profusion across the face of the planet. Only Boron malcontents are lacking in numbers due to the somewhat arid atmosphere of the world.\n\nThe official view of the Paranid Empire and the Priest Dukes on behalf of the Priest Emperor is that the war is of little consequence to Paranid interests. The sector does not sit astride any unique routes across space, indeed has always been something of a side market for the Paranid Empire's merchants. For whatever reason the Split Families appear to regard it as important enough to send troops there. Alternatively, some observers of the Split have suggested that the troops are being so readily sent in order to give them combat experience. It seems likely that the troops will gain that in abundance as it is reported that the AFS rebels are hiring offworld mercenaries specialising in ground combat. The AFS control a number of resource-rich regions and appear well able to finance large mercenary armies.

The bar staff are upset that legislation outlawing smoking of Spaceweed at the bar area is not being enforced strictly enough. One barman commented "the other tazura, I was working normally, felt a bit faint, and then woke up 10 stazura later mildly addicted to Spaceweed and nursing the mother of all hangovers. It can't go on like this."  Paranid pilots have expressed their concern at being unable to buy drinks for the next wozura. Argon pilots on the other hand, do not seem too concerned, with one stating "Paranid bars are filthy disgusting places anyway. I'd rather jump a couple of sectors just to get back into Argon space and drink there." This last comment prompted a fight between Argon and Paranid pilots just as this reporter left.

Desperate to break away from the shadow of her famous father's career, the young Timanckelfund had just started a fledgling career as a trader. Her ship was attacked and sadly quickly destroyed in a matter of sezura, the whole event happening with such speed that she could not eject from the craft. Her cargo of Energy Cells was picked up and the assailant then jumped out of Dukes Domain to an unknown sector. No ID of the attacker was made. Given that her cargo was relatively low value, there is speculation that this was neither a trade dispute nor an opportunist pirate, but rather an assassination. The search for the attacker will continue - no reward has yet been offered.\n\nRomanckelyang, Social Affairs Correspondent, IPN News[/justify][/text]</t>

Outer plantations were devastated by lava flows and seismic shocks, which led to the majority of injuries.\n\nThere are indications that poorly-built worker blocks in the outer plantations collapsed and killed several hundred while injuring many thousands. The area of the plantations exceeds 50,000 square kilometres in an area around the titanic Ianamus Mons crater. The circumference of the lower edge of the volcano slopes is over 100 kilometres.\n\nKetimas Etequis Uiiquys V - Outer Worlds Correspondent CBNN News [/justify][/text]</t>

It appears that once submerged in water, the Teladi fabric, the design of which is a closely guarded secret, reveals a lustre deeply desirable to Boron fashion sense. Teladi boutiques are reportedly running low on stock, despite tripling the price in true Teladi fashion. An added bonus for the Boron is that when wet, this fabric is also incredibly comforting and luxurious to the touch, and seems to soothe their skin. Fashion is not without it's dangers though - when this fabric dries slightly it also constricts very quickly, and several Boron ladies, including it is rumoured the Princess, have had to be cut out of their clothes in public - most embarrassing!\n\nYoyunis Towisaris Yooses IV, Foreign Affairs Correspondent, CBNN News[/justify][/text]</t>

It was a courier ship undertaking a long journey without the use of a jumpdrive. As far as we know, after entering Profit Share through the south gate, the ship started to fire at everybody in range, killing the nearest two or three innocent pilots.\n\nShe was screaming and shouting for another pilot she supposedly imagined that was trying to stop her. However no ship in the nearest location, escaping from the insane pilot, has identified any ship firing at her. The pilot was screaming something about herself trying to take her out. After six mizuras the pilot, still screaming and shooting around was killed without warning by the police forces. "Poor pilot, she was trying to kill her alter ego" - Dasinos Tumulis Zuzuamis, our local psychiatrist has a perfect explanation of a pilot's situation.\n"It is commonly known that the working time for all Teladi is much higher than for other races". "This accident is not exceptional". "The Teladi are brought up that the credits are the most valuable thing in their life, so they don't think so much even about a little reposing" "They don't know it could easily bring even death to them"\n\nSo we appeal to the all Teladi public - "Please, if you feel uncomfortable, tired, fatigue, you have spent already a long time in space - take a rest for a couple of stazuras. This will help you and other creatures in the surrounding area or if you're in journey- you will bring more safety to other pilots of any kind".\n\nTzessosis Hoaenos Holigis V - Social Affairs Correspondent CBNN News[/justify][/text]</t>

While some have suggested this was caused by maintenance failures, the hot theory is that a terrorist or mercenary faction has carried out a bombing. Argon security are hunting for any and all leads that could point to one group over another. It is reported that the Argon are even looking hard at the activities of the other powers, though it is highly unlikely that even the Split would directly sponsor an attack on an Argon station.\n\nWhile it would be highly embarrassing for the Argon authorities if this explosion does turn out to be the result of negligence and therefore a simple accident, it would be far more interesting if a terrorist group has decided to embark on a campaign of indiscriminate bombings on targets in Argon space. The latter would tie up many security resources that the Argon are currently relying on in their anti-piracy operations.

The amateur gambling champion was fleeced for a cool 15 million credits when the mining corporation she had invested in folded leaving several backers without a credit chip to show for it. Trantaeos claims she was approached by a character called Max Enron who spoke of developing silicon seams in Treasure Chest sector. However, our sources say the gullible gambler was duped by the old tale of nividium under the rocks.\n\nTrantaeos has asked the Profit Guild to step in but they are known to be unsympathetic when a Teladi foolishly loses every credit in some scheme that goes bankrupt. Even were they to be interested, the Argon authorities in Treasure Chest say they have no record of  "Max Enron" and report that the New TC Mining Group was registered using, irony of ironies, a numbered account at the Profit Guild Bank in Seizewell.

The Teladi pilot, Yalos Trosulis Rungisass II, used a jumpdrive fitted to her modified Boron Octopus to skip 4 sectors on the course. The usual punishment for cheating during a race is for the offender to be released into a planetary atmosphere to burn to death. This punishment was avoided however, as 3 of the other race pilots tracked down the cheating Teladi and destroyed her ship, killing her instantly. In the absence of the original "winner", the prize of 10,000 credits was awarded to the pilot who was the first to finish without cheating, a Paranid pilot named Sao't Sht. The bonus of 5,000 credits for beating the course record has been returned to the race organisers.\n\nIn related news, it would appear that gate race pilots are improving in skill. After a season of races where the average number of competitor deaths from collisions was 25, and the individual races never had less than 12, it is interesting to note that the last race only contained 4 deaths. This includes the death of Yalos Trosulis Rungisass II, the cheating Teladi pilot. A good example of evolution at work.\n\nVal Gisler - Sports Correspondent, MIN[/justify][/text]</t>

Nobody is owning up to carrying out the raid which is probably wise given that the weapons were bound for Split colonial defence forces in the region. The missiles are one of the best types available and will attract a nice price on the market. Better still, our friends might choose to use them on Split cargo convoys and bring more credits into the underground economy.\n\nThyn's Abyss and the other Split colony sectors in the area are proving a fertile ground for raiders this jazura as the Families struggle to maintain security so far from their home sectors. It isn't all plain thrusting, as opportunities to repair and refit are few and far between for known pirate groups.\n\nOberon Waellsly - Crime Correspondent MIN News [/justify][/text]</t>

The faithful will remember when news broke last month of claims that Malus could perform the near infinitesimal calculations required to predict blind jump co-ordinates into undiscovered sectors of space.\n\nMalus claims to have found dozens of new sectors and many fledgling stellar races in his month-long survey mission, launched shortly after his Astronavigation breakthrough. Priests from the second house have openly refuted his claims, stating that micro-debris analysis of his Jump Drive equipped ship, the Elindor, would prove if he had visited undiscovered systems. They are standing by the findings of their own research departments that insist the calculations required for a blind jump are still impossible by today's computer technology.\n\nSecond House nominary Bael Katek said "The data put forth by his charter of new systems can easily be obtained through astronomy techniques that have existed since the beginning of science. As no one can physically verify his claims we suggest a great deal of caution before anyone elevates his supposed findings into fact."\n\nMalus claims he is not planning any more excursions at this time, stating that his research needs thorough examination in order to plan the exploitation of this new science. Argon representatives have made the usual appeal for information sharing via diplomatic channel upon hearing of this news.\n\nIon Gren - Science Correspondent - GCN News[/justify][/text]</t>

Initial reports are favourable, however much of the original structure has once again been buried in the shifting sands. Tremors have also been reported and the team is using hover-dwells tethered to the surface to keep the lab equipment safe from both the sand and after-shocks.\n\nSo far the team has indicated they are making significant progress in mapping the area and analyzing material samples from the only part of structure still visible.\n\nIon Gren - Science Correspondent IBC News[/justify][/text]</t>
 <t id="4">[article/][author]{1294,60}[/author][title]Maybe it is not Xenon?[/title][text cols='2'][justify]Scientists on the Fairwather team have been reportedly split in their opinions as to the results of the materials taken from the structure on Regcalus V. Speculation is rife that the structure is not manufactured but more of a naturally weathered piece of metal rich volcanic rock. Aaron Fairwather has refused to speculate and is determined that the team must proceed with a proper excavation of the site.\n\nThe weather patterns in the area are reportedly going to get worse with a major sandstorm expected within the next two Tazuras.\n\nIon Gren - Science Correspondent IBC News[/justify][/text]</t>

"Noah explained everything" said one tourist, "Noah went into great detail of our ancestry. It was unbelievable, we never knew there was so much information available about it." Noah's final tour took the tourists to the holographic room, where they were shown the short holofilm that was found on an asteroid a long time ago in the old sector of Rhonkar's Clouds. The tourists were amazed and in a way sad at the way the earth was befallen by the chaos of war with the terraformers, and how they got the name of Argon. Derived from Nathan R. Gunn, the captain of the fleet that tricked the terraformers to follow them through a secret gate which was later destroyed. The group was awed at the chase that lead the earth fleet through many sectors in this universe. Some were in tears at the way the earth fleet was gradually picked off one by one by the evil terraformers, now known as the Xenon. The final crash by the remaining ship from the earth fleet and how they finally settled down on Argon Prime.\n\nMany tourists had never heard of the earth test pilot that ended up stranded in the Teladi sector of Seizewell, and how his ship had got here without the use of a jumpdrive. Kept secret for many jazuras by many governments, they learned how he had found the holographic data disk in the old sector of Rhonkar's clouds, which the earth pilot had returned to the Goners, the final battle that took the races to final victory over the Xenon, and how they kept the Xenon in retreat to now form the current shape of the universe.\n\nNoah Gaffelt later said, "I always love the final part of the tour, as the tourists watch in horror at the holographic movie, it's a tragedy and in a way gives us many lessons to learn about the war which befell earth.

In an effort to conclude this argument and gain more knowledge of the tournament which our conservative brothers are calling 'a brutal excuse for the conflict of war without the political implications' and which continues to divide our brotherhood a Goner Chiun Ta Cho master, Master Hwange was entered as an Argon competitor.  As you all know the art Chiun Ta Cho is practiced among us to preserve the body and calm the spirit and has no direct connection with violence of any kind.  Nonetheless Master Hwange was able to defeat his first opponent the paranid, Falix Halifalix by methodically avoiding his blows for 17 hours before Falix collapsed of exhaustion.  Master Hwange then forfeited his place in the competition by refusing to face fellow Argon, Nathan Gunner. It is uncertain what experiences Master Hwange will share\nwith us when he returns but it is certain that while our brotherhood is divided over this issue we must remember that it is our only difference and that we may disagree here and remain united in other things, preserving our order, as we have done in less fortunate centuries than this one.\n\nJo Springer - Social And Culture Correspondent IBC News[/justify][/text]</t>

Clean shaven Goners argue that they are being discriminated against - all the high council have beards and infact there has never been a clean shaven Goner elected to this lofty position. The beard brigade dismiss this as nonsense, and have suggested that if the clean shaven Goners spent more time worshipping and studying instead of worrying about facial hair, then maybe they would in time become more worthy of a council position.

The conservative members of the temple wish to see no changes, and are proud of the distinctive way that Goner ships are displayed on other pilot's radar. They feel as missionaries spreading the word of R Gunn that they should stand out from other space traffic. The progressives however feel that this distinctiveness is the very reason that so many Goner ships have been attacked or captured of late, and that these attacks are hindering the word being spread around the universe.

Using very highly focussed matter transporters, the team has demonstrated the ability to remove and implant matter into the body of any given person. The surgical applications for such a method are almost without limit and can be used with any species.\n\nDoctor Katarin Delayn said: "This is truly a great advance. With this technique of micro-matter transmission we can remove harmful cells, such as cancers, and deliver useful matter, such as targeted drugs or medical implants, without open surgery. Imagine the benefits!"\n\nDoctor Delayn described for GCN how the procedure had been tested using volunteers drawn from the Goner faith: "We have sought at all times to be consensual and have refrained from animal testing. However, there are clearly animal healthcare applications as well as those for sentient races."

Marais was born an Argon in the Herron's Nebula sector and made a life for himself as a fighter pilot. He took part in many engagements and several of the border wars that have cursed our age. A chance encounter with one of our brothers, whose name is not known, changed the life of Brother Marais.

Famously he asked a Split warrior, visiting the Temple as part of the then Split Ambassador's entourage, "How sharp is a sword with no blade?" Much taken with this, the Split warrior went away. Several mazura later, that warrior, Kao 't Pst, became the first Split to follow the Goner Way.\n\nBrother Marais had a great sense of humour and while he could publish such masterworks as Philosophical Investigations into the Hidden Universe, he could also produce the famed and much-loved No Joke Left Unturned, acknowledged by many professional comedians as a fund of material.

Whilst we are completely opposed to slavery, particularly of our own, it is interesting to note that this has resulted in more conversions to our faith. It seems that our captured missionaries have continued to preach the faith to their fellow slaves, who are converting in their droves. Rumour has it that the Split mine owners are concerned about this, but cannot stop the religion spreading as every time they try to suppress it, another martyr to the cause is born. It is extremely gratifying to know that the Goner faith is helping so many slaves come to terms with their conditions now.

The High Council had taken all races by surprise when they entered this jazura, the 'honoured' Goner being Jes Ramussen. It was thought that this experiment would promote greater understanding and conversion within the Split race, plus Jes Ramussen was convinced that his faith would allow him to overcome the fearsome Ghok without the need for violence. Entering the arena in an almost trance-like state, the contest ultimately lasted just under one mizura, and then only that long as the Ghok appeared to have trouble swallowing Ramussen's clothing in addition to the rest of his body \(Goner robes are quite prickly and itchy\).

They argue that the sale or purchase of Goner ships should be made illegal, as they could only have been sourced by illegal means. Shipyard owners disagree, saying that this would stifle the free-market liberal trading economy that the races have worked so hard to establish, and would set a precedent that could lead to other products being banned as well. The debate was sparked after the High Council released the astonishing figures for last jazura, reporting a loss of 207 ships, and after new ship production, a net loss of 45 ships. This has prompted the High Council to demand that captured ships be returned to the Goners and their former owners prosecuted. The shipyard owners have adamantly refused this, in the interests of the confidentiality of their clients.\n\nMiria Gisler, Communications Correspondent, GCN News[/justify][/text]</t>

The mercenaries, who  had all knowledge of their employers chemically wiped out, were to use a matter transporter to deliver a primed Hornet class missile into the main concourse of the station. If such a weapon were to detonate in an unshielded area of that kind it would tear the facility apart.\n\nGoner Intelligence have long monitored the whereabouts of matter transmission devices and became concerned some mazura ago, when a transmat-equipped Teladi vessel was reported lost to a pirate attack. It now appears that agents of Goner Intelligence were successfully able to trace the device and pass on the information to Argon authorities.\n\nWhile the mercenaries have no memory of their employers, they were able to name a numbered account at the Teladi Profit Guild Bank in Company Pride. Argon agents found the account to be empty after obtaining a warrant from Guild authorities. The Teladi factor in the affair has been noted but seems nothing more than circumstantial at this time. No motive for such a vicious attack on a trading station other than to create sheer terror has been discovered.\n\nBal Mulligan - Security Correspondent GCN News [/justify][/text]</t>

 <t id="1">[article][eval if_race='argon'/][/article][author]{1294,10}[/author][title]Military Exercises Commence[/title][text cols='1' colwidth='500'][justify]All races have been invited to take part in a set  of military exercises, but for some reason the Paranid will not be taking part this year. "Not everyone can attend" was their response when asked why they had declined.\n\nExercises will range from shooting a series of target containers to navigating through an asteroid field in the quickest time possible. Each race will compete in a series of events and will be awarded based on their performance and response to various 'battle scenarios'. \n\nHach Burnett - Foreign Affairs Correspondent IBC News[/justify][/text]</t>

The owners will appear in court tomorrow, and will be sued an estimated 20,000cr. for service fees. The technicians demand settlement before Mazura-012, and will take the matter to higher authorities if a settlement isn't reached.\n\nHach Burnett - Foreign Affairs Correspondent IBC News[/justify][/text]</t>
 <t id="4">[article][eval if_race='argon'/][/article][author]{1294,10}[/author][title]Military Exercise costs lives[/title][text cols='1' colwidth='500'][justify]Two ships collided in an asteroid scouting exercise, and no one is yet sure as to what caused the collision. It is thought that faulty hardware might have had a part to play in the collision, and engineers are salvaging what's left of the two M4 class fighters.\n\nBoth ships belonged to the Teladi, and they have withdrawn from further scheduled exercises for the time being. The two pilots were new recruits, but their names are currently being suppressed. "Our prayers go out for the two pilots, and we hope that they heard the good news before their sudden departure" cited Priest Hamsling. Other exercises will continue in a day's time, in respect to the two lost pilots.\n\nHach Burnett - Foreign Affairs Correspondent IBC News[/justify][/text]</t>

Buyo remarked.\n\nWe asked what are these terrible consequences only to get from him: "This information will remain disclosed to people above a certain clearance level, but we can assure you, you wouldn't want to know."\n\nFui't Plt - Foreign Affairs Correspondent SFN News[/justify][/text]</t>

The ex-prison official, Temon Buyo, commented at the press conference prior to the holding of the meeting, that:\n\n"It would be better to keep the sentence as it is. The split aren't feared the way the Xenon or Boron are... we must make sure that everyone knows that we aren't pushovers".\n\nFui't Plt - Foreign Affairs Correspondent SFN News[/justify][/text]</t>

Demand has skyrocketed since the start of the troubles with the Kha'ak. It may be a short term effect with more Teladianium Mines coming on-line every Tazura. Aggenmenas Glutamus Fakatos, the chief Broker for the company said "The market shows sign of a shortage that should correct itself in the medium to long term. We are recommending a buy at the moment".\n\nThe owner of the Brokers, Thelisias Pontamonen Arakos IV, owns more than half of all Teladianium mines and was unavailable for comment.\n\nYoyunis Towisaris Yooses IV - Foreign Affairs Correspondent CBNN News[/justify][/text]</t>
 <t id="11">[article/][author]{1294,80}[/author][title]First impressions from the Intergalactic Meeting of the Secretaries of Space Transport[/title][text cols='2'][justify]The representatives of the races are now negotiating on some new regulations for intergalactic space transport. The most important changes will be made to the rules regarding the Jumpgate Exit Procedure, the placement of satellites and overtaking of slower spacecrafts. It is planned that so called "gate sleepers" are to be fined a high amount of credits. "Gate sleepers" who accelerate too slowly after having passed the gate have caused a lot of accidents in the past, especially in sectors with high traffic density. Still there is a controversial debate on whether to make the use of Boost-Drives mandatory for spacecrafts with low acceleration capability in order to enable them to leave the dangerous area fast enough.\n\nBut, as all the races will have to ratify the treaty and integrate the new rules into their national legislation it will take a couple of Jazuras until the new rules become official.\n\nFunfi Pi - Transport and Tourism Correspondent - GalNet[/justify][/text]</t>
 <t id="12">[article/][author]{1294,80}[/author][title]More impressions from the Intergalactic Meeting of the Secretaries of Space Transport[/title][text cols='2'][justify]The representatives of the races are still negotiating on some new regulations for intergalactic space transport. We can now present some more details: There will be special areas for the communication satellites to place them into space. This is meant to be a measure against the "wild" placement of satellites as it is being practised nowadays. Satellites get destroyed too often causing increasing troubles for the indemnification insurance business. The Teladi delegation proposed to protect these satellite areas with SQUASH mines. While the Paranid have already agreed to this proposal and the Split are expected to follow, the Boron and Argon are likely to offer some resistance because of their general ban on these weapons. They prefer lasertowers.\n\nBut, as already mentioned in another article, because all the races will have to ratify the treaty and integrate the new rules into their national legislation it will take a couple of Jazuras until the new rules become official.\n\nFunfi Pi - Transport and Tourism Correspondent - GalNet[/justify][/text]</t>

 <t id="0">Tutorial: Basic Controls</t>
 <t id="5">(_Voice is a nice yet authoritarian military guide. Male_)Welcome to the Argon federation space academy simulator. My name is Uri Seldom and I'm your guide in this level of the simulation. -- Since this is only a tutorial session to familiarize you with the controls, you are allowed to skip this simulation at any time by pressing the QUIT key or by selecting QUIT from the menus.</t>
 <t id="101">To access the ship computer please press the "main-menu"-key now.</t>
 <t id="103">0</t>
 <t id="110">0</t>
 <t id="111">It is time to try out the weapon systems of your ship. A few containers have been deployed around your ship. Do not shoot at them yet! Target one of the containers by using the "target next/previous"-keys. Only objects close to you can be targeted.</t>
 <t id="112">Well done! Now go ahead and destroy all containers.</t>
 <t id="113">Very good, all containers have been destroyed. A second batch of containers will now appear near you. Please destroy them this time with different laser. -- If you have more than one laser in your ship you can exchange it. To do so now, please open the weapon selection menu either directly or through the main menu.</t>
 <t id="114">Good. Now close the menu and destroy all containers with this new laser!</t>
 <t id="115">00</t>
 <t id="116">Your task is to pass through all Kessler rings which are still marked with a green light. Your target has been set to one of the rings to make it easy for you to find the first ring. Just follow the arrows.</t>
 <t id="120">Good work, the containers are destroyed. Your ship has an automated freight load-and-deploy system which you can use to salvage objects from space. In order to not interfere with operation of the ship shields, the shields are temporarily shut down while the system is active. -- To activate the system and open the loading bay you have to select the menu item "open freight bay doors" in your shipmenu. Then fly over the container to load it into your ship. Shortly after successfully catching the object, the loading system will deposit it in your ship's cargo hold.</t>
 <t id="121">0</t>
 <t id="122">Your task is to find and collect one of the containers. Fly over the container after you opened the cargo bay.</t>
 <t id="131">When you are very close to the other ship, you can select the "enter ship" item in the shipinfo-menu for the ship you are about to enter. - A personal tip: Look up the hotkeys for actions like opening an info menu or for directly entering or leaving a ship.</t>
 <t id="132">Oops, you entered your old ship again! Leave, and fly over to the other ship, please!</t>
 <t id="133">You are not close enough yet. </t>
 <t id="140">Congratulations pilot. You finished part 1 of the training simulation. </t>
 <t id="999">(_used for main menu_)You can select between tutorial and practicing sessions. Tutorials are optional to learn basic as well as advanced features of the game.  Practicing sessions however have to be finished successfully to activate further levels of the simulator.</t>
 <t id="1111">Target one of the containers by using the "target next/previous"-keys.</t>
 <t id="1132">Good. Now select the item "your current ship".</t>
 <t id="1133">This is the ship menu for your ship. Please select the item "weapons" now.</t>
 <t id="1134">You now see an overview of your ships laser bays. You can now select a new laser. Please install the beta particle accelerator cannon in one of the bays.</t>
 <t id="11321">Please open up the main-menu now.</t>

 <t id="1">The central place from where you can reach every menu is the main-menu. You can enter it by pressing the "main menu"-key.</t>
 <t id="2">OK. After this short introduction to some important menus we will get to the real action now. Point the nose of your ship to the space-station and press the "target"-key to select the station as your target.</t>
 <t id="4">Good work. You now own two upgrades which we are going to try out now. Please leave the station.</t>
 <t id="5">Well done. Now fly into a landing platform to bring up the stations menu.</t>
 <t id="6">Your target has been set to an M5-class ship. Don't be afraid, it is completely defenceless and waits to be destroyed by a mosquito-missile. By pressing the "select missile"-key you can cycle through the missiles available. -- Alternatively you can select a missile from the "weapons"-menu of your ship. -- Now select the mosquito missile, fly to the ship, keep it targeted and press the "launch missile"-key.</t>
 <t id="7">Transporter successfully destroyed. Congratulation pilot - You have finished the part 2 of the training simulation. </t>
 <t id="10">You see the information has been sorted in "Player", "Navigation" and "Target" pages. Select "Message Log" from the "Player"-page.</t>
 <t id="11">This is the "Ship-Menu". Using "scroll up/down" keys you can scroll through the passive information part at the top. -- Selecting items in the lower active part of the menu is done with "menu selection Up/Down" keys. -- Please select the item "ship details" now and confirm with "select".</t>
 <t id="12">You can now see detailed information about your current ship. You can open this same menu for other, even for enemy ships as well. To scroll use the "scroll up/down" keys. Now press the "back" key to go back to the "ship-menu" and from there select the "command console" menu.</t>
 <t id="13">This is the "Command-Console" of your shipcomputer. Here you can program your shipcomputer or that of other ships you own but which you are not sitting in yourself. Please press the "back" key and select the "freight bay"-item.</t>
 <t id="14">You are now in the "weapons-menu". From here you can install available lasers into your main cockpit and - in case you sit in a bigger ship - into the ships turrets. Also missiles can be installed. Please press the "back" key and then select the "freight bay"-item.</t>
 <t id="16">Here you can see information about your titles and rankings, your statistics and log entries. Use "scroll up/down" keys to scroll. Please press the "back" key now and then go to the "Navigation" tab and select the "universe-map"-item.</t>
 <t id="17">The "Universe Map" shows all sectors you already have visited. Not every sector is linked to all of its neighbours! Please press the "back" key and select the "sector map"-item.</t>
 <t id="18">This perhaps is the most important source of information. It bears ALL information for objects present in a system which are in range of your scanners plus some static information about stationary objects that you have visited before. -- Moveable objects, like ships, disappear once they are outside the range of your scanners. -- You can zoom in and out with the "zoom in/out" keys. The "switch" key switches between top and side view. -- Additionally objects can be filtered by selecting the "Stations" or "Ships" tab. You can use this map for easier navigation in space by targeting an object first from the map and then flying towards the marked arrows. Now close all menus.</t>
 <t id="22">Within your scanner range you can see the object identified as "Teladi Trading Station" which has two yellow arrows next to it, this is the station you have targeted. You can upgrade the range of your scanners at some Equipment Docks by the way. Please close all menus again now.</t>
 <t id="23">OK. Now let's dock at the Trading Station! To do this you need to request permission to land. Open the COMM menu either directly using the COMM key or through the menu system. </t>
 <t id="24">Select "request permission to land".</t>
 <t id="31">You see the menu of a station. From here you can see what ships are owned by this station, which are landed and with "station details" you get an overview of the goods the station deals with. But what we want to do now is trade with the station to buy some upgrades. So - select the "trade with station"-item.</t>
 <t id="32">Now buy the "docking computer" and the "best buys locator" from this station. To do this, move the bar to the appropriate item and use the "menuselection left/right" keys to select the amount you want to buy or sell. In our case you want to buy one unit of each. Confirm your selection with the "select" key.</t>
 <t id="41">It's time to check out the destructive power of some different missiles. But first you'll have to buy them. Using the Best Buys locator, you can now find out where to buy an item as cheap as possible. -- When you open up the ship menu for your ship you can find an additional menu item named "Best Buys Locator". Choose it to activate this upgrade.</t>
 <t id="42">You see that there is one station offering  the lowest prices for all three missiles we want to use. Dock there! This time you can spare the docking procedure because you already own a "docking computer" upgrade. --  Fly towards the cheapest station and from a distance of about 3.5km a new menu item called "docking computer" appears in the "Target"-tab of the main-menu. Use it or learn the correct hotkey, to dock automatically and safely in the station. </t>
 <t id="50">0</t>
 <t id="51">Select "trade with station" and buy one missile of each kind.</t>
 <t id="52">Good. Now start from the station.</t>
 <t id="62">Your last target is a small transporter. Its actual shield and hull strength are far below the destruction power of the silkworm missile. Try destroying it as well.</t>
 <t id="72">You are not supposed to buy missiles right now. The deal was rolled back.</t>
 <t id="110">This menu stores all messages you receive during flight. In this and the following simulations you can use it to review the instructions. Press the "back"-key and choose the item "your current ship".</t>
 <t id="152">OK. The plankton has been ejected. This way you can also lay out mines or satellites. Satellites can help to remote control your ships or even your own station in distant sectors. They have wide range scanners and deliver this information to your shipboard computer navigation map. Please press the "back" key and then select the "Your Personal Information"-item.</t>
 <t id="231">Once you targeted an object, you can obtain detailed information about it via this menu. Also, you can communicate with it with the "communication" item. Select this item now.</t>
 <t id="601">What a pity you did not hit the ship. You will be given another mosquito missile. Please try again.</t>
 <t id="602">Of course the missile you selected would be strong enough to destroy the ship, but for this simulation please use the mosquito-missile for this ship.</t>
 <t id="611">Missed! Dragonfly missile reloaded. Please try again.</t>
 <t id="612">The silkworm missile surely is powerful enough to destroy the ship, but for this simulation please use the dragonfly missile to destroy the targeted ship.</t>
 <t id="621">Bad luck! Reequipped with a silkworm you should try again...</t>

 <t id="0">Welcome back to the Argon federation space academy simulator. My name is Uri Seldom and in this simulation I will introduce you to different possibilities of setting up views on your HUD.  (_a little enthusiastically_)At the end of this session you will learn how to build your own factory.</t>
 <t id="1">By pressing the "next cockpit"-key you can cycle through the different cockpits of your ship. Every ship has at least one main-cockpit and - depending on the ship class and size - one or more turrets. The ship you currently sit in - the Argon Nova - has two cockpits. To go to the other cockpit, press the "next cockpit"-key now.</t>
 <t id="2">I will now introduce you to the monitor system. A great invention to make handling of ship groups easier. Switch on the monitors in the options-menu or by pressing the "toggle monitors" hotkey.</t>
 <t id="3">Currently both monitors are disconnected. One way of attaching a view to a monitor is via the ship-menu. Open up the ship-menu for your ship.</t>
 <t id="4">Below the headline "Monitor mapping" you see some menu items which can be attached to a monitor. Now first select the item "Cockpit: Back", then select "Monitor 1" and confirm the selection.</t>
 <t id="7">You now see the ship's main cockpit in the monitor-view. Try to accelerate and steer the ship.</t>
 <t id="8">There also is a camera view. Activate it by going to the shipmenu, and setting "external view" to monitor 2.</t>
 <t id="9">You now see your own ship from the outside in monitor 2. Activate monitor 2 and try to move the camera with the "cameracontrol" keys. Additionally you can zoom in/out with the "camerazoom"-keys. -- All of this is possible in all modes. So you can even set your large main view to an outside view of your ship and press the camera mode button to let it circle around in cinematic mode while you control your ship from one of the small monitors.</t>
 <t id="10">Now switch back to the main-view with the "next monitor"-key and from there return to the main-cockpit view with the "next cockpit"-key.</t>
 <t id="11">0</t>
 <t id="18">You can see that some enemy ships appear in front of your ship. The ships are unarmed and have poor shields. Target them, engage them and destroy them with your lasers!</t>
 <t id="19">Very good. Now there are some ships behind you. Switch to the backturret and shoot at the ships.</t>
 <t id="20">Good work. You should now be able to figure out how to setup monitors in a way that is useful for you. Now let's build a factory. Factories are sold at shipyards. Of course they are too big for your ship to carry, so you must hire a bigger ship that transports the station for you. Recently an Argon Mammoth jumped into the sector near your location. Point your ship's nose towards the large transporter. Target it by pressing the "target"-key.</t>
 <t id="21">The first thing to do is to hire this TL-class ship. Open up the communication-menu for the TL. You want to talk to the Captain aboard this ship.</t>
 <t id="22">When talking to him, choose "want you to transport something" and agree to the offer.</t>
 <t id="23">OK. You have hired the TL. Next it must be told to dock at the shipyard. Open up the comm-menu once more and talk to the captain.</t>
 <t id="24">Now choose the item "please move to shipyard..." and in the following menus select the current sector and the "Federal Argon Shipyard" inside of it.</t>
 <t id="25">Well done. While the TL docks at the shipyard, please dock there as well. Fly towards the shipyard, make it the current target and - when you are about 4km away - request to land.</t>
 <t id="26">Please wait until the TL has docked outside this station, too. To observe the TL you could set its external view of it to a monitor...</t>
 <t id="28">Good. Select trade with station now.</t>
 <t id="29">You see that the station sells only one solar power plant. Buy it!</t>
 <t id="30">Now you are asked where to load the factory. Of course that's why we have hired the TL. Choose Argon Mammoth.</t>
 <t id="31">OK. The TL now has the station on board. Close all menus and leave the station.</t>
 <t id="32">Next, please target the hired TL.</t>
 <t id="33">Now you have to search a good place for the station. In real space you would have to find out, where such a worthwhile place is but for now it's good enough to build it anywhere in the sector. -- Therefore command the TL to follow you and then lead the Transporter a little bit away from the shipyard.</t>
 <t id="34">Good. Now it is time to let the Transporter drop his freight. Keep in mind that you have to be close to the TL for this command to be displayed. You will then be shown a "Sector Map" where you can select the final position of your station. -- Use the "Camera-Control"-keys to move the co-ordinates and use the Sector Map controls to zoom.</t>
 <t id="35">OK. You can watch your station build up automatically.</t>
 <t id="36">Congratulations. You have successfully completed this simulation.</t>
 <t id="252">The Argon Mammoth has the wrong command. Please open the comm-menu again and tell the captain to dock at the shipyard.</t>

 <t id="0">Welcome back to the Argon federation space academy simulator. --My name is Uri Seldom and in this simulation I will finally introduce you to the most advanced techniques of trading and running a business. --You are about to learn not just how to run your own cooperation, but even advanced tricks and tips how to use a whole fleet of ships to manage an empire effectively. --If you are not interested in such advanced management skills yet or plan a different career you can skip this simulation session at any time.</t>
 <t id="1">Transporter 1 of Cahoona</t>
 <t id="2">Transporter 2 of Cahoona</t>
 <t id="3">Transporter 1 of Forge</t>
 <t id="4">Transporter 2 of Forge</t>
 <t id="10">Please assign a command to ship "Transporter 1 of Cahoona"  to automatically bring Argnu Beef to your factory. One possibility to do this is to go to the appropriate menu - is to select the Cahoona Bakery and then access the list of "landed Ships". -- Now choose "Transporter 1 of Cahoona" and select command console. Command the ship to "Buy ware for best price..." from the TRADE commands. -- This means that the ship will continue to buy resources for the station from another station. As resource to buy, please select "Argnu Beef".</t>
 <t id="20">Well done pilot! Transporter 1 knows now what to do. If you want to give "Transporter 2 of Cahoona" the command to buy Energy Cells the same way, you will notice that this command is not available yet. -- The reason is that this ship has no homebase yet. -- To set the homebase, go to the command console of "Transporter 2 of Cahoona" and set the homebase to "Cahoona Bakery".</t>
 <t id="30">OK, the ship is ready to get the resource for its homebase. Make "Transporter 2 of Cahoona" get Energy Cells like before.</t>
 <t id="40">OK, parameter set correct. The next step is to get the required resources for the Forge. It needs Energy Cells, Ore and Cahoona Meatsteaks. We will get the Meatsteaks from our own station once it has produced enough. -- Now we will get the Energy Cells manually. To do that first give "Transporter 1 of Forge" the command to "Dock at..." the Solar Power Plant. -- Another, shorter way to go to the command console of a ship is to use the "Owned Properties"-menu to directly choose the right transporter.</t>
 <t id="70">It would be a good idea to use this transporter also to get the Cahoona Meatsteaks from your Bakery. Commmand "Transporter 1 of Forge" to dock at the Cahoona Bakery.</t>
 <t id="82">Good, please wait until it has landed there. To shorten the waiting time you could activate the Singularity Engine Time Accelerator.</t>
 <t id="90">The Bakery has now produced enough Meatsteak Cahoonas! Load at least 100 Meatsteaks into your transporter via the menu item "Adjust station parameters".</t>
 <t id="100">Very well done! You already have passed the hardest part of the steps to successfully complete this simulation! -- The next thing to do is to bring the resources loaded in "Transporter 1 of Forge" to the forge. Command the transporter to "Return home", to make it fly to your Forge.</t>
 <t id="102">OK. The transporter is on its way. Please wait until it has landed - Once the transporter is landed, you can manually unload the resources to the Forge and the production of the laser can begin.</t>
 <t id="111">"Transporter 1 of Forge" has just landed. Please transfer the Energy Cells and the Meatsteak Cahoonas to the forge. As explained earlier, you can do this via "Adjust station parameters" from the ship-menu.</t>
 <t id="112">Good work! The forge is going to produce the urgently needed EPT weapon - the enemy ships are closing on to this sector! The production time for a laser of this class has been slashed in this simulation.</t>
 <t id="113">The time is over! The second laser has been produced. Install the lasers quickly into your ship! To do that you have to land in the station and then transfer them to your current ship. You only have three minutes left before the enemies arrive!</t>
 <t id="114">Enemies are attacking! Defend your station NOW</t>
 <t id="115">Congratulations! You have successfully completed this simulation - A new level of simulations is now activated - Good luck!</t>
 <t id="1010">Please care for the right transporter.</t>
 <t id="1020">The ship has the wrong command. Please command the ship to "Buy ware for best price..." and then choose "Argnu beef".</t>
 <t id="2010">Oops, you have mistaken the advice - please set the homebase to Cahoona Bakery!</t>
 <t id="2020"> Please set the homebase to Cahoona Bakery first.</t>
 <t id="3010">You have given a wrong command. Command the ship to "Buy ware for best price..." and then choose Energy Cells.</t>
 <t id="3020">The homebase has been reset to Cahoona Bakery.</t>
 <t id="3110">If you take a look at the landed ships, you will notice that the two transporters are still on board the Cahoona Bakery. The ships can trade only if the station has enough money. --  Give 10000 credits to the station and set the buying prices for the needed resources to their maximum. -- Do this via the "Adjust station parameters" item in the station-menu.</t>
 <t id="3120">Please move 10000 Credits of your money towards your station. By setting the parameter credits to 10000. Set Energy Cells and Argnu beef buying price to maximum!</t>
 <t id="3220">Please set credits of the Forge to 35000 and the buying price of Ore to maximum first!</t>
 <t id="4010">You are about to give a wrong command to the ship or sending it to the wrong station! Please command the ship to "Dock at..." the Solar Power Plant.</t>
 <t id="4020">The homebase has been reset to H.E.P.T Laser Forge.</t>
 <t id="5010">The transporter has a wrong command! Command it to "Buy ware..." Ore and then choose "Ore Mine Alpha".</t>
 <t id="6020">You have bought too much, therefore the transaction is being partly rolled back. It would be clever to use this transporter also to get the Cahoona Meatsteaks from your Bakery. Commmand "Transporter 1 of Forge" to "Dock at..." the Cahoona Bakery.</t>
 <t id="7010">The transporter has the wrong command. Tell it to "Dock at..." the Cahoona Bakery.</t>
 <t id="7210">"Transporter 2 of Forge" has loaded the Ore, needed by the Forge.</t>
 <t id="7220">"Transporter 2 of Forge" has brought the Ore to the Forge.</t>
 <t id="7230">Your Cahoona Bakery has the needed resources and begins producing the Meatsteaks now.</t>
 <t id="8310">Please wait until the Cahoona Bakery has produced an amount of 100 Meatsteaks.</t>
 <t id="9010">You have unloaded Energy Cells, that were determined for the Forge. This transaction has been rolled back.</t>
 <t id="9020">Load 100 meatsteaks in "Transporter 1 of Forge".</t>
 <t id="10010">The transporter has a wrong command! Command it to "Return home", making it fly to your forge.</t>
 <t id="100000">In this sector we already have a small business cycle. You own two stations:</t>
 <t id="100001">a Cahoona Bakery, producing Cahoona Meatsteaks,</t>
 <t id="100002">and an H.E.P.T Laser Forge, which needs Cahoona Meatsteaks as well as other good to manufacture a large laser.</t>
 <t id="100003">Your task is to produce one urgently needed - Alpha H.E. Plasma Thrower - short "EPT".</t>
 <t id="100004">First supply your Cahoona Bakery with the needed resources.</t>
 <t id="100005">Therefore bring Argnu Beef from the Argnu Ranch,</t>
 <t id="100006">and Energycells from the Solar Power Plant to the Cahoona Bakery.</t>
 <t id="100007">Your Cahoona Bakery already has two transporter-ships supposed to get one resource each.</t>

 <t id="100001">You'll have to defend the Titan against a whole fleet of attackers. The additional problem however is that some of the enemy ships carry hornet-missiles. These ships are the biggest threat in this simulation, as they can seriously damage your Argon Titan destroyer.</t>
 <t id="100002">One of the enemies has been identified as a weak traitor. It carries information about which ships carry the dangerous hornet-missiles.</t>
 <t id="100003">You will have to chase and attack the traitor with your remote-controlled Argon Nova fighter first, to get the information about the missile-ships. As soon as you know which ships are the missile-ships, destroy them as quick as you can.</t>
 <t id="100004">While you are busy hunting the traitor, your Argon Titan is being attacked by the enemy. You should make it defend itself by giving the "Turret kill enemies" command. </t>

 <t id="300051">We must rebuild, (Cut to shots of a dockyard at work) we must make Argon strong once more. My fellow senators and I are drawing up emergency plans and we call upon all our citizens to be ready for the war we fight. A war unlike anything we have faced before. We must be vigilant. (Cut to pictures of Argon warships). We must heed the call to fight for justice and freedom. We must find and we must destroy the Kha'ak where ever they may be found. This is the day for justice. This is the day for freedom. This is our day!</t>
 <t id="352302">My fellow senators. Today we are a planet awakened to danger. And while we have been touched by tragedy, the fires that brought it have only made the spirit of all our citizens burn more brightly. And in this light we see our course. We will not be broken. We will not surrender. We will prevail. Applause, cheering.</t>
 <t id="352304">They don't talk, they don't listen. They aren't interested in dialogue. They are only interested in death. Death in the thousands. And it isn't just Argon that is a victim. Innocent Paranid, Split, Boron and Teladi, are our allies in suffering (Pictures of alien suffering). And I speak to them as much as to the senate. Let us find the Kha'ak homeworld, let us find this house of evil and let us rid ourselves of our enemy (we end on a Kha'ak ship exploding).</t>
 <t id="700003">...and it's about time we realised that the only thing that will stop this is their total destruction. The Kha'ak aren't interested in peace. They attacked for no reason and now it is time for us to teach them their mistake.</t>
 <t id="700005">These are strong times. Let us send a message to the Kha'ak. Either we will see an end to this war, or we will see an end to them.</t>
 <t id="800419">It is a warning to us all to remain vigilant. There are still forces that seek to destroy us and our battle for security, our search for just salvation, our need as a people of the free must continue. There are those who seek to destroy us and we will defend ourselves against them.</t>

<page id="300119" title="Ban Danna" descr="" voice="yes">
 <t id="310208">The patrol will start near the North Gate in Home of Light. From there take the West gate to Red Light. Cross Red Light and use the South gate for Cloudbase South West. Check for Kha'ak activity in these sectors and eliminate any Kha'ak ships you come across.</t>
 <t id="310209">The flight leader's got some combat experience, but the rest are rookies. Hopefully, you'll get there without incident, but stay sharp and try and keep those pilots alive. We're going to need them.</t>
 <t id="430101">You can join the fleet by the Terracorp Nividium plant in Home of Light. The fleet is made of mixed ships so be careful, they could spread out due to their different speeds - particularly if you hit trouble. Pass on my regards to the fleet captain when you reach them.</t>
 <t id="730706">Julian, I've had to use secure channels to send you this message. The senate have now declared you renegade, so you'll have to stay out of sight of Argon and Paranid installations. Both governments are talking to the other races and it won't be long before at least the Boron also declare you renegade. The only way out of this is for you to find out what the Paranid are doing and why.</t>
 <t id="730707">Hopefully, by now you've met up with the Don. He'll help you get what you need.  I think your instincts about a cloaking device are correct. It's not something we've been able to achieve, but there have been rumours of the Paranid succeeding. We'd been wondering how they managed it and you're right, the probability is that it was with help from this alien 'Sargon'. The question is - why Sargon suddenly chose to stop working with the Paranid and go to Ion instead.</t>
 <t id="730708">However they built the cloaking device, it will have been expensive and it will require huge amounts of energy to maintain, so whatever they are doing it must be worth a lot to them.</t>
 <t id="730709">By the way, the senate has also insisted that we return the Seed. The Paranid are sending a convoy to pick it up from us.</t>
 <t id="730710">Find out what they're doing, Julian and come back when you can prove it. Good luck!</t>

<page id="300129" title="Salik" descr="" voice="yes">
 <t id="300050">Hello and welcome to this special edition of Argon Today. In this programme we look at the Kha'ak war and ask the question - Why?</t>
 <t id="300052">Here in this vid we witness the first of the Kha'ak's ruthless assaults on our civilisation(cut to existing footage without the V.O.), the attack at President's End. And, whilst there has been no major attack on Argon settlements since the battle at Omicron Lyrae, the Kha'ak continue to destroy ships and installations, to murder innocent civilians. But, as Argon forces seem unable to find a Kha'ak homeworld or even to communicate with this merciless enemy, we are left with few answers and fewer options for retaliation.</t>
 <t id="300053">The only person to have a close encounter with the Kha'ak is Kyle Brennan who was lost to them whilst searching for the AP Gunner and a way back to Earth(bring up a picture of Kyle set against footage of the ship). - Hero of the Xenon war, Kyle remains in intensive care, unresponsive, as much a mystery as the Kha'ak who left him this way. Kyle's son Julian Brennan(Use a picture of him and some of the opening from X2) previously known as Julian Gardna, a notorious pirate, was one of those who helped defend Argon in the crucial battle at Omicron Lyrae. Since then there has been a relative calm, but with Argon forces at an all time low it can only be a matter of time before the Kha'ak return. Will we be ready to defend ourselves? What do the Kha'ak want? Someone who thinks they know the answer is Senator McCarthy.</t>
 <t id="352301">Hello and welcome to Argon Today coming up ... Boron spas, the latest in relaxation innovation(picture of a happy Boron in a walk-in bath?). A pirate's life for me, we talk to a Yaki pirate and ask them, why(A picture of a Yaki/pirate attack)? But now on Argon Today, we take a spotlight look at Senator Joana McCarthy.</t>
 <t id="352303">Senator Joana McCarthy speaking only hours after the Kha'ak attack on President's End. While there are those who are still seeking ways to open negotiations with the Kha'ak, Senator McCarthy is a leading hawk who thinks the only solution is the complete eradication of the Kha'ak race.</t>
 <t id="441201">Moving to news outside Argon, the Paranid Empire suffered its heaviest attack to date with huge loses to all ships and stations in the Empire's Edge sector. The Paranid minister for unholy affairs(drop in a photograph of the minister) has stated that their priests fear it is the taint of the unholy two eyes that has brought the wrath of the Kha'ak on their empire. To counter this fear, (Cut to pictures of the Paranid military Vessels taking up position by gates)all central Paranid sectors are being declared off limits to non-Paranids. All non-Paranid owned material in these sectors is being seized by the authorities.</t>
 <t id="441202">Argon diplomatic sources are yet to officially respond to this, but advise all Argon citizens to leave these sectors immediately. (Back to the studio)Sources close to the Pontifex Maximus Paranidia(add a picture of the Pontifex, or at least an artist's impression labelled as such) claim that any non-Paranids failing to comply with the order to leave will be destroyed. And now, the weather...</t>
 <t id="700002">Words from the frontline, which today reached Argon Prime itself with the Kha'ak launching a devastating attack on our central sector. And with fires still burning across Argonia and several outlying cities, we go live to the Senate building for a statement by Senator McCarthy...</t>
 <t id="731201">...and following the dramatic escape(some shots of the player's prison ship escaping and a disruptor missile knocking out a patrol ship) of three prisoners including both Julian and Kyle Brennan, the Paranid Empire has accused the Argon senate of colluding in the get away. The Paranids are now threatening to take military action.</t>
 <t id="731202">In a counterclaim, Argon sources have stated that the Paranid empire is withholding information vital to the fight against the Kha'ak. As the diplomatic words heat and Paranid forces build on the border(we see Paranid ships gathering) it appears that Argon could soon be fighting a war on two fronts.</t>
 <t id="800418">And with the disappearance of Kha'ak forces across all systems, we are all able to take a breath and be thankful that peace has returned, for the moment anyway.</t>
 <t id="800420">Next week, Earth - legend, religion, now fact. We ask are they friend, or are they foe? As the Terrans continue their silence and the Paranid draw new treaties with us, will we find we have more in common with our Paranid neighbours, than with our Terran brothers? This is Salik Harith. This is Argon Today.</t>

 <t id="310101">Julian, thanks for coming. I've got a squadron fresh out of flight school due on their first combat patrol. I'd like you to show them a few tricks.</t>
 <t id="310103">The fleet's down to 30% ...and we don't have many old pilots left to teach the new ones. Can you think of a more important task? You'll get chance to put your life on the line soon enough. I just hope your father recovers soon to give us some insight into the Kha'ak. Have you been to see him?</t>
 <t id="310107">Julian...</t>
 <t id="310109">I'll hold you to that. Ban Danna out.</t>
 <t id="430001">Julian, I heard what happened with the White Stone.</t>
 <t id="430003">What do you need?</t>
 <t id="430005">I'm afraid Argon Prime's not keen on loaning out equipment at the moment, but there's a Terracorp Nividium convoy in Home of Light that needs an escort. You help out with that and it should help me get you some spydrones. I'll be in touch.</t>
 <t id="431501">Julian, I've traced some spydrones, but I won't be able to get them released until you've helped out with that Terracorp convoy.</t>
 <t id="431502">I'm sorry, Julian, but I can't release those spy drones until you've helped out with a Terracorp convoy. There's another one gathering by the Nividium plant that needs an escort.</t>
 <t id="431503">Julian, I've traced some spydrones, but I won't be able to get them released until you've helped out with a Terracorp convoy. There's another one gathering by the Nividium plant. They'll be ready to go in a few hours.</t>
 <t id="431506">They'll be ready to go in an hour.</t>
 <t id="540002">Julian, could you meet me onboard, Argon One? I've heard you might have plans of those Yaki missiles and I'd like to see them.</t>
 <t id="540102">Julian, please could you meet me on board, Argon One.</t>
 <t id="540201">Welcome. I'm afraid Miss Marani will have to stay on her ship. If she was to be seen onboard...</t>
 <t id="540203">(Ignoring her)Those plans you recovered are going to come in very useful, Julian. We'll analyse them and I'll let you know when we have some answers. In the meantime, why don't you visit your father?</t>
 <t id="540206">Good, come aboard and I'll have someone escort you down.</t>
 <t id="710001">Julian, I have news of your father. He regained consciousness during the Kha'ak attack on Argon Prime, but before I could speak to him he stole a ship and left the station. His doctors have evidence that at the moment the Kha'ak arrived, his brainwaves matched the pattern of the Kha'ak jump events. I'm afraid word of this has got back to the senate. Senator McCarthy thinks he is being influenced by the Kha'ak and has ordered that Kyle must be found and, if he refuses to return, the search party has permission to fire on him.</t>
 <t id="710002">I can't delay the search fleet forever, but I can give you a headstart. Before he went, your father looked up files on the AP Gunner. As you know he was looking for the Gunner before he disappeared, so I believe he's headed where you found it in Nyana's Hideout. We have to know what's important about that ship and what he discovered about the Kha'ak.</t>
 <t id="710003">Find him and bring him home safe, Julian. I can't believe your father would betray us.</t>
 <t id="720204">If there is a link, and I have to say 'if' right now, Kyle, then that would explain why the Kha'ak have hit the Paranid so hard.</t>
 <t id="720207">I think it's time we found out.</t>
 <t id="720209">I'm sorry, Kyle, this is one for Julian. (To Julian) You have a pass that gives you access to the Paranid central sectors?</t>
 <t id="720211">Then I think you should do a little reconnaissance. I'll have a ship prepared. Take care of any business you have and return to Argon One, we'll have it ready for you.</t>
 <t id="720230">Ah, Julian. The ship is ready. Good Luck, we're counting on you. Though I'm sure Saya will keep an eye on you.</t>
 <t id="720231">Julian. The ship is ready. Please return to Argon One.</t>
 <t id="720233">Good to see you're eager. It will take us another few minutes to install the equipment. I'll contact you as soon as it's done.</t>
 <t id="720234">Ah, Julian. The ship is ready.</t>
 <t id="720235">Good Luck, we're counting on you.(Then into 720212)</t>
 <t id="720501">Hello, Julian. I'm afraid you need to scan those installations, we'll need proof if you are to go to the Argon senate and the sooner you get it done it, the sooner we start saving lives. Ban Danna out.</t>
 <t id="720601">That's a start, Julian. It looks like your father was right, but we'll need more proof. Go back with Saya and scan the rest of those installations then we can start putting this right.</t>
 <t id="722802">Julian, please return to Argon One immediately. There have been some developments.</t>
 <t id="722902">Julian, please return to Argon One immediately. The Paranid Empire has declared you a criminal for the murder of Armanckessilon and for the theft of the Seed. It looks like Argon will also agree to declare you a criminal. You need to return here as soon as possible so we can sort this out.</t>
 <t id="723002">Julian, the Argon Senate has voted to declare you a criminal. Your assets have been frozen and if you do not return immediately, then steps will be taken to bring you to justice. You must return as soon as possible.</t>
 <t id="730005">Julian. I'm sorry about this.</t>
 <t id="730007">She's fine. Julian, have you heard of a Paranid called Armanckessilon?</t>
 <t id="730009">His family claims you murdered him and a Paranid called Nolmancketnun has alleged that you stole the Seed.</t>
 <t id="730011">A well known pirate isn't going to help your case, especially as the Paranid are threatening to declare war. They say we've let them take the worst of the Kha'ak attacks and are already negotiating with the Split. With our fleet spread so thin...I'm afraid the senate has decided to hand you over to them.</t>
 <t id="730013">Senator McCarthy pushed through a senate decree two hours ago. You, Ion and your father are to be transferred to Argon before being sent to Paranid Prime. As a pledge of honour you're being allowed to fly yourself. I urge you NOT to escape, Julian. (Hint) If you were to escape and find evidence of what's been happening then you would be on your own. And if you ran to the Don Marani, well that might confirm your guilt, no matter how helpful it might be.</t>
 <t id="730101">Julian, if you deviate any further from your flight plan then security vessels will be sent to stop you. This is your last warning.</t>
 <t id="800101">This is Argon One to all Paranid ships. Cease all hostile actions immediately.</t>
 <t id="800103">Massive power readings from normally calm space? You're an incredibly easy person to find. Where's Kyle?</t>
 <t id="800106">Now, I should arrest you, but right now, I think I'd rather offer you parole and a chance to help out.</t>
 <t id="800111">I've put out a call, but Kha'ak are attacking several systems, the fleet can't spare any more ships</t>
 <t id="800112">We've got to hold the line.</t>
 <t id="800119">We're losing too many ships!</t>
 <t id="800121">Julian, that M2 needs help!</t>
 <t id="800124">Kha'ak M0 coming in!</t>
 <t id="800125">Julian can you get over there and man their turrets until they get their shields back?</t>
 <t id="800142">There's another wave of suicide ships heading towards you! I'm transferring you to a fighter to intercept!</t>
 <t id="800150">Julian, Redoubt's weapons are offline, can you cover her while they make repairs?</t>
 <t id="800153">This order is direct from the Pontifex Maximus Paranidia and the senate council. You are hereby placed under my command. Any Paranid ships disobeying this are to be destroyed, at the Pontifex's pleasure. End of general transmission. (Some sort of visual clue to the switch) Julian.</t>
 <t id="800154">All ships, engage the Kha'ak fleet.</t>
 <t id="800166">Argon One requesting covering fighters.</t>
 <t id="800201">You leave now, Julian and there's no way the senate will forgive you.</t>
 <t id="800402">Great maker! All forces pull back.</t>
 <t id="800404">We haven't the ships. We must gather the fleet to protect Argon.</t>
 <t id="800409">Kyle, good to hear from you old friend.</t>
 <t id="800412">Earthfleet, please accept our thanks. I speak here on behalf of all...</t>
 <t id="800430">All ships, set course for Argon immediately...</t>
 <t id="800431">Come in Renown...(Static) Come in Illustrious...(Static)</t>
 <t id="800433">We might not have the forces to defend ourselves. All ships, return to Argon immediately.</t>
 <t id="800436">All ships - engage until destroyed.</t>
 <t id="800438">And may the maker be with you.</t>
 <t id="811004">Ah, Julian, yes, I might have just the thing, I'm transmitting details.</t>
 <t id="811005">Credits? Yes, I have something you can do...sending now.</t>
 <t id="811006">If you have the time, I do have a mission for you.</t>
 <t id="811007">Ah, Julian, yes, I have a mission for you. I'll send you the details.</t>
 <t id="811008">Certainly, check your messages for a briefing.</t>
 <t id="811009">I'm afraid you'll have to finish the mission I gave you first. I'm resending details.</t>
 <t id="811010">I've given you a mission already, finish that and we can talk. Resending details.</t>
 <t id="811011">Finish the one I gave you and we'll talk.</t>
 <t id="811012">I'm sorry I don't have any more information. Good luck.</t>
 <t id="811013">You'll have to find things out yourself, Julian, Ban Danna out.</t>
 <t id="811014">We don't know anything else I'm afraid, you'll have to find out.</t>

 <t id="330008">Your mother would be really proud. Trust me.</t>
 <t id="330101">Closer, we don't want to lose him in those asteroids, but watch out for those missiles!</t>

 <t id="350017">I don't know what they shot me full of, but I don't think I'll ever sleep again.</t>
 <t id="350019">Let me guess, mass destruction and the end of the galaxy?</t>
 <t id="350021">Then let's see what he's got to say and find whoever stole the crystal.</t>
 <t id="350026">(The sound of Julian stirring.)</t>
 <t id="350302">Don Tony Marani, you are to return the White Crystal, or you will be destroyed.</t>
 <t id="350305">Not that damaged.</t>
 <t id="350313">Where did he go?</t>
 <t id="350337">This is for Dogun!</t>
 <t id="350339">Give us that crystal!</t>
 <t id="350345">You really think he's letting us have it?</t>
 <t id="350724">It wasn't a pirate ship.</t>
 <t id="350727">I've lost it.</t>
 <t id="350735">He's dropping something.</t>
 <t id="350747">Lower your shields and return the white crystal</t>
 <t id="350749">Don't think he likes your jokes.</t>
 <t id="350756">This is for Dogun!</t>
 <t id="350758">Careful, it might not be the crystal.</t>
 <t id="351602">One dangerous rock seeking a safe home.</t>
 <t id="351605">Do you believe in coincidences?</t>
 <t id="351607">I'd better warn Noah. I don't want that crystal going missing again.</t>
 <t id="410002">Hasn't Ion told you? I recovered it from the Don.</t>
 <t id="410006">Er, bad news, I just stole it for him. How bad is that? I mean, what do these stones do?</t>
 <t id="410008">Oh, yeah. I think Ion and I need a little chat.</t>
 <t id="410510">Do they play fair in these things? Or am I going to get thrusters in my face?</t>
 <t id="410512">Great.</t>
 <t id="410513">Okay, Noah, so who do we talk to?</t>
 <t id="410925">And the Rookie takes the lead.</t>
 <t id="410926">Now who's the Rookie? You, dimwad!</t>
 <t id="410927">Coming through!</t>
 <t id="410928">I thought you guys could race!</t>
 <t id="410929">In the zone!!</t>
 <t id="410930">Nobody tell you? There's a new champion in town.</t>
 <t id="420101">This is Julian Brennan calling Thomus Beckitt, come in please. (Pause-static). Thomus Beckitt, come in please, this is urgent! (Pause-static)  I'm not getting any response. (Comm. opens) Thomus Beckitt, this is...</t>
 <t id="420109">If we ask Ban for some tracking equipment, we can listen in from a distance.</t>
 <t id="420111">Bet he's great at parties. Come on. Let's see what Ban's got in his box of tricks.</t>
 <t id="430002">(Rueful) Yeah. We've got a line on this Ion guy, but we're going to need some help if we're to reel him in.</t>
 <t id="430004">A way to listen in on a meeting, but without anyone knowing we're there.</t>
 <t id="430006">One of these days someone's going to help me just cos they like me.</t>
 <t id="430201">Argon escort to Terracorp fleet captain.</t>
 <t id="430203">Since when've you been a cargo jockey?</t>
 <t id="430205">What's so urgent about Nividium?</t>
 <t id="430207">You get anything on that ship? The one we couldn't recognise?</t>
 <t id="430209">And?</t>
 <t id="430403">I see them! Transporting over</t>
 <t id="430408">I'm a sitting duck in this thing. Transporting back to my ship.</t>
 <t id="430502">Computer, hit the...</t>
 <t id="430702">Try and hold it together, we can...make it out of here</t>
 <t id="430902">Terracorp owes me a lot more than that.</t>
 <t id="431004">Haven't you got anything better to do?</t>
 <t id="431008">You do realise that Saya's coming the chances of this being a secret mission are about a thousand to one?</t>
 <t id="431504">Argon escort to Terracorp fleet captain.</t>
 <t id="440002">Yeah, but I'm not planning on getting close, not without a defence against those disruptor missiles. Let's use that asteroid field for cover.</t>
 <t id="440004">Hide and wait.</t>
 <t id="440006">Here he is.</t>
 <t id="440402">Shields down. They've got missile lock.</t>
 <t id="440506">You trying to encourage me, or distract me, Saya?</t>
 <t id="440522">Looks like a drone.</t>
 <t id="440702">Bastu!</t>
 <t id="440704">Too late!</t>
 <t id="440803">All this for a light show?</t>
 <t id="440806">What is it?</t>
 <t id="441002">Okay, let's lose these guys.</t>
 <t id="441103">All that time my father spent searching, and now someone's found it.</t>
 <t id="450003">I'm not Yaki, you dimwad!</t>
 <t id="450010">You want to talk or fight? Cos I'm happy with just talking.</t>
 <t id="450011">You've got the wrong guy!</t>
 <t id="450014">I haven't touched your daughter!</t>
 <t id="450302">What little girl? Have you gone completely spacehappy?</t>
 <t id="450304">I'm not Yaki. okay? They tricked me into stealing the White Stone.</t>
 <t id="450306">Do you know anything about these missiles they use? The disruptors?</t>
 <t id="450308">Then you got a deal.</t>
 <t id="460302">I had a visit from the Don Marani. Apparently the Yaki have his daughter. We free her, he helps us get rid of the disruptor missiles.</t>
 <t id="460304">Last he heard, she was on the trading station.</t>
 <t id="460306">You get any time off, take some comedy lessons.</t>
 <t id="460702">The crumbs lead to this silicon mine, we should check it out.</t>
 <t id="460703">A whole heap of nada.</t>
 <t id="460902">I'm looking for Miria Marani.</t>
 <t id="460904">I'm here from the Don. You want me to call him? You think the Don wants to come down here?</t>
 <t id="460906">The Yaki?</t>
 <t id="460911">If we do we find her we can't attack the station. That'd put her at even more risk.</t>
 <t id="460913">I think we should offer the Yaki some bait.</t>
 <t id="460915">I think you'll make a wonderful slave girl.</t>
 <t id="461002">What do you want most out of life?</t>
 <t id="461004">That's because you've got your mother and Terracorp. When you've not got roots, it's easy for one thing to take over your life.</t>
 <t id="461006">Let's check out further East we're getting nothing here.</t>
 <t id="461008">You work for Terracorp, you found things quiet there?</t>
 <t id="461010">Let's try some silent running. I don't want the Yaki picking up any comms and running scared.</t>
 <t id="461012">You? Come on admit it, you can't wait to play hostages and pirates.</t>
 <t id="461602">Mines, there they are! Sooner they ban these things the better.</t>
 <t id="461703">Er, a bit late with the undetected, Saya.</t>
 <t id="462101">These guys just don't know when to give up.</t>
 <t id="462201">Now that's going to take some redecorating.</t>
 <t id="462203">Oh, yeah! How about I knock on the door and ask nicely?</t>
 <t id="462205">Get into the station (We see the hole in the spacestation), right? At least the Yaki've left the backdoor open.</t>
 <t id="462208">Great start.</t>
 <t id="462209">One ship, one careful lady owner. Time to get onboard.</t>
 <t id="462210">Okay, Saya, I've picked up your ship in the docking bay, give me your co-ordinates and let's get out of here!</t>
 <t id="462212">The reactor's going to blow.</t>
 <t id="462215">I'm getting there.</t>
 <t id="462219">Traffic was terrible. Can you fly this?</t>
 <t id="462221">Then transport me back to my ship. I'll fly escort duty.</t>
 <t id="462226">I'm on my way!</t>
 <t id="462233">The good news.</t>
 <t id="462235">Great! What's the bad news?</t>
 <t id="462237">Is there any other way out?</t>
 <t id="462239">Great, turrets.</t>
 <t id="462240">And this suit was brand new.</t>
 <t id="462241">Got to get the timing right...</t>
 <t id="462905">Is she okay?</t>
 <t id="462927">Did you get Miria out?</t>
 <t id="463605">So...what do we do now? A whole group of slave girls wasn't in the plan.</t>
 <t id="463610">Er, yeah. Me too.</t>
 <t id="463802">It's me.</t>
 <t id="463804">I believe we had a deal.</t>
 <t id="500302">I had things to do. Did you bring the information?</t>
 <t id="500305">Did you bring the information?</t>
 <t id="500502">Let's pay the Paranid a visit.</t>
 <t id="500504">They've only shut the central sectors. Let's head to Emperor Mines and see what we can do after that.</t>
 <t id="500505">Let's visit the Xenon. I've always wanted a look at that old M0.</t>
 <t id="500507">(Covering) What?</t>
 <t id="500509">Yeah, but yours didn't save the universe. Try following that.</t>
 <t id="500511">(Lightening) Well, everyone makes mistakes.</t>
 <t id="500514">Let's take a look at the Yaki. If we sort out those missiles it'll make things safer for us.</t>
 <t id="500516">What is it about girls and space? Does it do something to your brains?</t>
 <t id="500518">Yeah, that I don't want a picture of. Let's go.</t>
 <t id="500803">Let's get the Paranid Crystal.</t>
 <t id="500804">Let's take a shot at the Xenon.</t>
 <t id="500805">Let's get those Yaki disruptor plans.</t>
 <t id="500810">Not yet.</t>
 <t id="510102">Yeah. Can you go over the details?</t>
 <t id="510106">No, I still want to get the Black crystal.</t>
 <t id="510107">No, let's sort those Yaki out.</t>
 <t id="510112">Glad you agree.</t>
 <t id="510155">Hmmm, you know, maybe we should go help Armanckessilon instead</t>
 <t id="510157">Let's go see.</t>
 <t id="510158">Hmmm, you know, maybe we should go help Armanckessilon.</t>
 <t id="510160">Yeah. Let's get the Paranid's crystal.</t>
 <t id="510303">We can't count on that and it doesn't help us get in.</t>
 <t id="510305">And in the land of the locked out, the two eyed Paranid is king. Let's go.</t>
 <t id="511308">I haven't got the money.</t>
 <t id="511311">Great lead, Miria, thanks.</t>
 <t id="511401">I'm transferring funds now.</t>
 <t id="511405">Then we'd better have some money ready for when he comes back.</t>
 <t id="511502">Er, you wouldn't consider say some trading station gift tokens or an I.O.U. instead? (Nolman's comm switches off). I guess that's a no.</t>
 <t id="512102">(cutting in at beloved) These guys have a script or what?</t>
 <t id="512104">Oh great and magnificent Armanckessilon. I seek an audience with you to purchase the Blue Sculpt if you can spare the time for this humble being.</t>
 <t id="512109">I've got 'em.</t>
 <t id="512111">I'm on them.</t>
 <t id="512201">Miria, that ship that just appeared. Keep an eye on it.</t>
 <t id="512203">That's what I want to find out.</t>
 <t id="512302">Why was it here? That thing's following me.</t>
 <t id="512304">It's more of a stalker ...</t>
 <t id="512502">Armanckessilon!</t>
 <t id="512504">You think we can control the Kha'ak now? They attacked us too!</t>
 <t id="512507">That ship, the one that disappeared, it must be after the crystal.</t>
 <t id="512508">Let's hope the crystal's in with the cargo.</t>
 <t id="512512">Too slow! Got it!</t>
 <t id="513002">The others they stole were part of a machine built by the ancients. You want to risk the Yaki getting hold of something like that?</t>
 <t id="513302">Head back to the Goner Temple.</t>
 <t id="513304">They're the people who can put the pieces of this puzzle together. It was a rogue priest that stole the first two crystals with the Yaki.</t>
 <t id="513401">Where is your contact again?</t>
 <t id="513610">I've changed my mind. Let's get the Paranid Crystal.</t>
 <t id="513612">You always talk this much?</t>
 <t id="513620">Let's take a shot at the Xenon Crystal instead.</t>
 <t id="513622">You want to stay here - you can.</t>
 <t id="513630">Change of plan. Let's get those Yaki disruptor plans.</t>
 <t id="513632">You're still living with your poppa and you want to give me relationship advice?</t>
 <t id="520002">A friend of mine called them tinboats until we got into fight with them, that changed his mind. You know they're supposed to have come from Earth to build new worlds?</t>
 <t id="520006">Don't know. Never spoken to him.</t>
 <t id="520102">Yeah, let's have a look at the Xenon.</t>
 <t id="520104">No, let's go and pay the Paranid a visit.</t>
 <t id="520201">You'd better wait here.</t>
 <t id="520203">It's my health I'm worried about, anything happens to you and the Don's promised to remove parts of me I'm pretty attached to.</t>
 <t id="520205">I wish it.</t>
 <t id="520301">Great, obviously the Xenon holiday destination of choice. Let's hope they've signposted that M0 for the tourists.</t>
 <t id="520302">And it said 'friendly welcome' in the tour guide. I just hope it's right about the M0 being here.</t>
 <t id="520401">Okay, computer, let's scan for cargo containers. (Add beeps for computer) And let's hope they don't know who my father is, that'd probably make them really angry.</t>
 <t id="520404">Nice, but not a crystal.</t>
 <t id="520405">You'd think it was my birthday.</t>
 <t id="520406">Come on crystal...come to daddy...</t>
 <t id="520407">It's got to be here somewhere.</t>
 <t id="520408">That was close.</t>
 <t id="520409">I'm complaining to Xenon tourism, they don't signpost anything.</t>
 <t id="520410">Come out come out where ever you are. Come out little crystal.</t>
 <t id="520411">So much space, so much...time to realise you're talking to yourself.</t>
 <t id="520412">All this effort, you think the Xenon could've managed a decent gift shop.</t>
 <t id="520413">Crystal? Check. Black? Check. Time to get the Bazani out of here? Check!</t>
 <t id="520502">I've got scorch marks all over the ship and nearly had a hole in me, but no crystal.</t>
 <t id="520505">No.</t>
 <t id="520601">Here goes. If at first you don't succeed...</t>
 <t id="520604">If that's your pep talk, I don't want to hear your put downs.</t>
 <t id="520606">Those little robots almost destroyed every living thing this side of the universe!</t>
 <t id="520702">Safely onboard.</t>
 <t id="520704">It's the proper way to do these things - last minute every time.</t>
 <t id="521201">Wait here I'll meet you when I get back...</t>
 <t id="530002">Yes.</t>
 <t id="530004">I'm going to ask you what to do. That's what the Don recommended.</t>
 <t id="530008">I'm sure the Argon authorities would be very...</t>
 <t id="530010">(Pause) I'd be very grateful. (Pause, uncomfortable) Why? What did you have in mind?</t>
 <t id="530012">How could I say no?</t>
 <t id="530102">Yeah, those missiles've caused enough trouble. We take out the Yaki's secret weapon then we're back in the game.</t>
 <t id="530103">Yes, let's take these disruptors out of the game. (Into - 530201)</t>
 <t id="530104">Well, I've got the computer components, so let's try your amazing super-secret plan.</t>
 <t id="530105">Let's get those plans. Will Jesan still help us?</t>
 <t id="530121">By pick up I'm thinking you just mean collect, right?</t>
 <t id="530122">Let's take these disruptors out of the game.</t>
 <t id="530201">So, what's the big plan?</t>
 <t id="530203">Very mysterious.</t>
 <t id="530205">10,000 credits worth of computer components it is then.</t>
 <t id="530303">Work?</t>
 <t id="530305">And he'll help us?</t>
 <t id="530402">What are these components for? The Yaki need to upgrade to play the latest games or something?</t>
 <t id="530901">That's the station.</t>
 <t id="530903">This is a pirate sector, flying slowly is suspicious!</t>
 <t id="530905">How close? (worried) And for how long?</t>
 <t id="530907">Sure, travel slowly. Cos, the Yaki aren't going to find it suspicious when I give their space station a haircut! Here we go.</t>
 <t id="530917">You do know we're being shot at?!</t>
 <t id="531001">Oh yeah, someone's suspicious! At least if we stay close to the station they can't use their disruptor missiles.</t>
 <t id="531002">Hurry it up back there.</t>
 <t id="531003">They really don't like us doing this. Or are they just trying to kill you? That I could understand.</t>
 <t id="531004">Okay, we just got popular again!</t>
 <t id="531106">I'll message Ban, let him know we're coming. I want to see what he makes of these plans.</t>
 <t id="531303">That baka just spaced me!</t>
 <t id="531602">No, I'll have to try again.</t>
 <t id="531801">For the missile plans, what was it you want me to get again?</t>
 <t id="531803">I've got the components. Where should I put them?</t>
 <t id="531807">What station was Jesan on again?</t>
 <t id="531810">The components?</t>
 <t id="531812">The computer components?</t>
 <t id="531814">No.</t>
 <t id="540205">Well, I...</t>
 <t id="550202">Then let's ask him. We know he wants the crystals but he doesn't know Ban's found a way to neutralise his disruptor missiles.</t>
 <t id="550204">Right. If Thomus lets him know we're transporting the crystals, we can give him a nice little surprise.</t>
 <t id="550206">They surrender and there'll be no more.</t>
 <t id="550209">I can't believe I've met someone who talks more than you! You being around is actually going to be peaceful.</t>
 <t id="550211">Okay, time to give the Yaki our surprise.</t>
 <t id="550215">Looks like you lost your edge, boys. You going to come quietly?</t>
 <t id="550216">Guess not. All ships attack!</t>
 <t id="550218">Everyone ready? The decoy should be here any moment.</t>
 <t id="550220">You get anything on that disappearing ship?</t>
 <t id="550222">Pull a Bonnis from a hat, then blow up a Paranid trader?</t>
 <t id="550224">I've seen the ship again, it tricked a Paranid into flying into an asteroid. If it is Daveed Zincfeld someone must've eloped with his assistant, cos he's sure in a bad mood. You think it is Sohnen?</t>
 <t id="550226">Whatever it is, I don't think it's good news.</t>
 <t id="550301">Keep the Yaki off that convoy!</t>
 <t id="550312">Give it up Ion, you're outnumbered.</t>
 <t id="550313">Surrender and live Yaki.</t>
 <t id="550314">Not so helpless this time, hey?</t>
 <t id="550402">He must be on that ship there.</t>
 <t id="550404">Carefully, we need him alive, Saya.</t>
 <t id="550502">Disengage your drive and prepare to transfer ships.</t>
 <t id="550504">I understand you got innocent people killed, so you understand unless you're a good little priest you're going to be tasting space.</t>
 <t id="550505">Signal Noah, tell him we have Ion aboard.</t>
 <t id="550519">That's lucky, I've already got the Black Crystal, so that's one we don't need to look for.</t>
 <t id="550521">Nope, only got that.</t>
 <t id="550802">Near the crystals and near Ion again.</t>
 <t id="551002">Not just me. I have a guest.</t>
 <t id="551005">It's you that's made the mistake, Ion. The planet you showed Thomus wasn't Earth.</t>
 <t id="551009">Believe your own eyes, this is Earth.</t>
 <t id="551010">Who told you it was Earth? Come on, Ion can't you see they were using you? Was it the Yaki? Was it the person in this ship?</t>
 <t id="551012">We can't create jump events. It's fantasy!</t>
 <t id="551015">What matters is stopping him from opening a gate to that planet!</t>
 <t id="551017">But it's not Earth, who knows where that gate'll take us. And if he's prepared to kill...but then you'd understand that.</t>
 <t id="610102">Only lead we've got though isn't it?</t>
 <t id="610104">Then let's try one of my contacts.</t>
 <t id="610106">You'd be amazed how much partying you can fit in between prison, pirates and Armageddon. Set your course for the trading station in Emperor Mines.</t>
 <t id="610302">He's one of Miria's contacts.</t>
 <t id="610304">So was I.</t>
 <t id="610306">We need some help...</t>
 <t id="610308">Then they would have found the asteroid he crashed into. Want to explain why a lowerlife can dodge asteroids and a Paranid can't? I need access to Priest Rings so I can build a mine, can you get me that?</t>
 <t id="610311">I'm more worried about how much this is going to cost us.</t>
 <t id="610313">Thanks for your support. You make me feel all warm inside.</t>
 <t id="610704">Julie?!</t>
 <t id="610902">How is the mining proceeding?</t>
 <t id="610905">We need to get that factory constructed for when they break through, oh and we'd better keep an eye out for our Sohnen friend.</t>
 <t id="610907">Isn't there some place you'd rather be?</t>
 <t id="610908">The great Nolmancketnun advised that this is to be expected and I bow to his wisdom.</t>
 <t id="611403">Good work! Nolmancketnun will be pleased. It is to be transferred aboard my ship.</t>
 <t id="611405">Surely a superior being knows.</t>
 <t id="612101">Sorry, Saya, that holiday will have to wait. I've already got the credits.</t>
 <t id="612103">Want to get in line for your third eye? I've got the credits.</t>
 <t id="612106">The feeling's mutual. Good news you're gonna get your holiday time. I'll meet you here when Nolman gets in touch.</t>
 <t id="612107">I'll see you later. Try not to start any wars while I'm gone.</t>
 <t id="612109">That's what I'm afraid of.</t>
 <t id="612110">Holiday over Saya, I've got the credits we need.</t>
 <t id="614407">Then you'll know that the energy waves it gives off cause mutations in a Paranid's reproductive organs. That's why a lowerlife has been asked to help you.</t>
 <t id="614409">I have pictures if you...</t>
 <t id="614411">Yes, your excellence.</t>
 <t id="614413">Yeah, let's get out of here before he asks for a check up.</t>
 <t id="614421">I don't know. I'm not sure I want to find out what it does, but at least we've stopped Ion and Sargon.</t>
 <t id="614423">Did you just say 'quiet'?</t>
 <t id="614425">If. Sargon told Ion what Ion wanted to hear. Who knows what's true, or where this thing would lead us. Do you want more of those ships suddenly turning up?</t>
 <t id="706203">Mine too.</t>
 <t id="710102">Yeah.</t>
 <t id="710104">And what am I supposed to say? Hi, I know you've never met me, but I'm your son. Oh, and by the way, are you a traitor?</t>
 <t id="710106">(Tense, irritated) Yeah, just great, Saya.</t>
 <t id="710301">This is...this is Argon Security Vessel 267 to Kyle Brennan. Stop your ship immediately.</t>
 <t id="710302">I repeat, this is...</t>
 <t id="710304">(To himself) Where've I heard that before? (To Kyle) I have my orders. Stop your ship immediately and...</t>
 <t id="710305">He should've stayed in his coma. Computer, scan that asteroid.</t>
 <t id="710307">(Beginning to realise the importance) Nividium?</t>
 <t id="710309">Great, that wreck almost got me killed first time round. (Deep breath) Okay, Computer, hold onto your hat. I'm taking us in.</t>
 <t id="710311">Why did I get up this morning?</t>
 <t id="710312">Where's he gone?</t>
 <t id="710314">Not without you.</t>
 <t id="710320">We've got to stop them.</t>
 <t id="710322">I'll take them out.</t>
 <t id="710324">I'll get them!</t>
 <t id="710802">What happened in there?</t>
 <t id="710804">So, why go alone?</t>
 <t id="710808">It's under control, Eagle Flight.</t>
 <t id="710812">Kyle Brennan and...(reluctant) Julian Brennan.</t>
 <t id="710905">Let's not do this over an open comm..</t>
 <t id="710907">You ever meet a Goner Priest called Dogun?</t>
 <t id="710909">There's a priest, Ion, who thought he'd found Earth. He got Dogun killed.</t>
 <t id="710911">How much is it worth? Any of it?</t>
 <t id="710913">Then what do we do? Surrender to the Kha'ak? Don't think they'd listen.</t>
 <t id="710915">Are you saying we started it?...(Penny drops) The Nividium. Has the Nividium got something to do with the Kha'ak?</t>
 <t id="710917">You think I don't know how that feels? I lost my past because of you, my friend because of the Kha'ak, and two Earth obsessives almost got me killed!</t>
 <t id="711501">Nooooo!</t>
 <t id="720206">But what do they want it for? Nividium's not really used for anything.</t>
 <t id="720210">Yes.</t>
 <t id="720213">Okay, let's find out what they're hiding.</t>
 <t id="720215">But why such big attacks? And why on us?</t>
 <t id="720216">Nividium.</t>
 <t id="720219">Why are the Kha'ak so interested in it?</t>
 <t id="720307">Hey, that was there when I got the ship, I just haven't had chance to clear out.</t>
 <t id="720310">What are you doing poking around?</t>
 <t id="720312">If you're that bored I can probably tap an adult vidfeed for you.</t>
 <t id="720314">You know I could've asked, Miria, or Mi Ton or anyone else to operate this equipment for me.</t>
 <t id="720316">Just configure it.</t>
 <t id="720703">You want to come or not?</t>
 <t id="720706">Had things to do. Come on, let's go.</t>
 <t id="720902">We have permission. Transmitting ID.</t>
 <t id="720904">The great Nolmancketnun did not have time to prospect asteroids, so he sent me as his humble servant.</t>
 <t id="721003">Got through a lot doing what?</t>
 <t id="721101">Try scanning that.</t>
 <t id="721103">Can you scan that?</t>
 <t id="721302">Who knows? I thought it was just a metal.</t>
 <t id="721502">Looks like their work.</t>
 <t id="721504">Wait, I've got something.</t>
 <t id="721506">We have clearance...</t>
 <t id="721902">Do you think they're hiding it because of the Kha'ak attacks? I mean once they started losing stations, it would make sense to move it.</t>
 <t id="721905">I don't think this is a patrol!</t>
 <t id="721912">If they've hidden it that means the Paranid knew the Kha'ak were targeting it! Nice of them to tell us. What's worth so much they let everyone keep suffering these attacks?</t>
 <t id="721915">Shimatta!</t>
 <t id="721917">Armanckessilon's the Paranid Sargon killed, these guys obviously didn't get the message that - IT...WASN'T...ME!</t>
 <t id="721920">You're attacking the wrong person!</t>
 <t id="722101">And you navigate for Terracorp convoys?</t>
 <t id="722103">You suggesting the Paranid've started a magic act?</t>
 <t id="722106">Where's he going out here?</t>
 <t id="722107">Now you see it...looks like everybody's getting in on the disappearing act.</t>
 <t id="722111">Yeah, but this isn't the only cloaking device we've seen is it?</t>
 <t id="722115">I told you, I didn't kill Armanckessilon!</t>
 <t id="722119">Change the sound-bite.</t>
 <t id="722121">Justice? I'm innocent!</t>
 <t id="730003">Trouble with a capital T.</t>
 <t id="730006">What's going on and where's Saya?</t>
 <t id="730008">Of course I have! I arranged to buy a crystal from him, but after the Kha'ak attacked, he flew off - straight into an asteroid.</t>
 <t id="730010">Look, you ask Miria...</t>
 <t id="730012">But what about the fact the Paranid were hiding their Nividium? They knew the Kha'ak wanted it. And you can't tell me there isn't a connection between a ship that can disappear and spacestation that can cloak itself!</t>
 <t id="730015">This is transfer vessel 8 7 departing en route to Argon.</t>
 <t id="730017">If you know what's good for you, Ion, you'll keep that mouth shut.</t>
 <t id="730019">They haven't. Ban's giving us a choice.</t>
 <t id="730021">Yeah.</t>
 <t id="730023">The jump drive's been disabled, if we don't get it online we're not going anywhere.</t>
 <t id="730301">How's that jump drive looking?</t>
 <t id="730303">Make it quick, we've got Argon security on intercept.</t>
 <t id="730305">I'll use disruptors. I just hope they know we're on their side!</t>
 <t id="730306">I'm going to try for a gate.</t>
 <t id="730317">Hurry it up!</t>
 <t id="730319">Our shields are almost gone!</t>
 <t id="730321">Oh, that's where I've been going wrong...</t>
 <t id="730323">They're shooting at us...</t>
 <t id="730328">We're out of here!</t>
 <t id="730329">We're still here.</t>
 <t id="730331">No hurry, it's only an escape attempt!</t>
 <t id="730333">This had better...</t>
 <t id="730341">I told you to keep quiet.</t>
 <t id="730346">I've already told you to stay quiet!</t>
 <t id="730348">You don't keep quiet, Ion, I'll jettison you to slow them down.</t>
 <t id="730349">Last warning, Ion, keep quiet!</t>
 <t id="730350">Ban hinted that Don Tony Marani might help us.</t>
 <t id="730352">Yeah? You wait 'til you meet his daughter!</t>
 <t id="730902">Why did Ban tell me to come to you?</t>
 <t id="730908">Ion. The man who wanted the crystal. The one that got your daughter kidnapped. Now, you say one more word, Ion and I'll hand you over to the Don.</t>
 <t id="740006">Whatever they're up to, it isn't here. They're heading out in convoy.</t>
 <t id="740011">Ion, what's this crystal like?</t>
 <t id="740014">Just tell us about the Seed.</t>
 <t id="740017">What do I need to do?</t>
 <t id="740602">Yeah, we'll have to wait for the next convoy.</t>
 <t id="740605">I don't see you volunteering.</t>
 <t id="741108">Priest Rings co-ordinates set, jumping.</t>
 <t id="750002">Duke's Domain.</t>
 <t id="750004">Well, then let's not get caught.</t>
 <t id="750206">And no one's going to Earth. Did Sargon say anything to you about the Paranid?</t>
 <t id="750208">Yet they suddenly have similar technology and know about the Seed? What's this ship that's following us, Miria?</t>
 <t id="750301">One jump drive ship.</t>
 <t id="750402">And we're too far away to see anything.</t>
 <t id="750404">Out here?</t>
 <t id="750416">Why are we going there?</t>
 <t id="750503">Let's get into that system. The sooner we get proof, the sooner I get my life back!</t>
 <t id="751002">It's cloaked, but I've got it on my scanners. They must highlight it so patrol ships don't crash into it. We're going to have to disable the cloak.</t>
 <t id="751004">Ban Danna said they take a lot of power. We knock out the power, we knock out the cloak.</t>
 <t id="751010">Well, no, they're Paranids.</t>
 <t id="751017">Yeah, only you just told them who you are...</t>
 <t id="751101">I'm picking up large amounts of Nividium. It's the gates! That's what they needed Nividium for!</t>
 <t id="751104">You can make gates, but no one knows how to create a jump event. There's this seed crystal...but only one, so why do they want so many gates?</t>
 <t id="751106">We'd better follow.</t>
 <t id="760104">They're trying to manufacture a seed crystal. That's why they kept this secret, build lots of gates, open their own trade routes. They'll control the economy!</t>
 <t id="760106">A lot of credits. I bet that's why they told Sargon to take a hike.</t>
 <t id="760112">Remind me to punch the next Paranid I meet.</t>
 <t id="760128">What about the other end?</t>
 <t id="760130">Wait! You don't know what the event will do to you.</t>
 <t id="760132">Let's get after him.</t>
 <t id="760150">You really think you can program that thing?</t>
 <t id="760152">Think's not good enough, Ion. You'd better do it or we're all going straight to bazani in little pieces!</t>
 <t id="760153">We're trying to help you, you baka!</t>
 <t id="760154">Where are we going, Ion?</t>
 <t id="760157">Tell a Paranid something's fragile and they'll hit it with a hammer to check.</t>
 <t id="760170">I'm getting a power surge.</t>
 <t id="760175">Yeah...I skipped science at school.</t>
 <t id="760177">Yeah. I get you on the station or we're all dead.</t>
 <t id="800001">And you said it was me that was always getting into trouble.</t>
 <t id="800009">We're on your side you baka!</t>
 <t id="800102">Am I pleased to see you.</t>
 <t id="800104">Earth, we hope. He entered the event.</t>
 <t id="800107">No chance of an apology and an account full of credits instead?</t>
 <t id="800109">Every ship we can get.</t>
 <t id="800110">You know that major attack everyone thought the Kha'ak were massing for? I think it just started!</t>
 <t id="800115">If the Kha'ak win they'll destroy everything.</t>
 <t id="800116">Paranid baka ne. If only we could tell the Kha'ak that we'll stop mining.</t>
 <t id="800126">Transporting over.</t>
 <t id="800141">Then who's this?</t>
 <t id="800154">I'm on my way.</t>
 <t id="800165">You had to say quiet didn't you? You just had to say it!</t>
 <t id="800169">We got the proof. Not that that will help, if we're all dead!</t>
 <t id="800303">It's Sargon.</t>
 <t id="800305">You want to risk Sargon doing something with the wormhole?</t>
 <t id="800307">Good luck, Saya.</t>
 <t id="800310">Ion, it's Julian. What's happening?</t>
 <t id="800312">Say again.</t>
 <t id="800314">Find an escape pod.</t>
 <t id="800317">There's something not right here.</t>
 <t id="800318">One of Sargon's tricks. This is going to be difficult.</t>
 <t id="800326">What about you?</t>
 <t id="800329">Computer! Eject! Eject!</t>
 <t id="800341">We need to get back and warn the others.</t>
 <t id="800400">(Julian's breathing - space suit.)</t>
 <t id="800411">I'm here, Saya, just about...</t>
 <t id="800432">Considering I flew through a disintegrating spacestation in a collapsing wormhole and my spaceship blew up, I think I'm relatively okay thanks.</t>
 <t id="810000">This is Julian Brennan calling Don Tony, I need to raise some credits, Miria said to come to you.</t>
 <t id="810001">This is Julian Brennan, I'm looking for another job.</t>
 <t id="810002">This is JB, do you have anything for me, Don Tony?</t>
 <t id="810003">This is JB, looking for another credit run.</t>
 <t id="811000">I'm looking for some credits can you help?</t>
 <t id="811001">I need to raise some credits, any ideas?</t>
 <t id="811002">I need some credits for the mission.</t>
 <t id="811003">I'm trying to raise some credits, how can I do that?</t>
 <t id="901004">You ready?</t>
 <t id="901095">How much?</t>
 <t id="902222">Yeah?</t>
 <t id="902225">Just one question.</t>
 <t id="950002">Another cargo container</t>
 <t id="950003">Let's see what's in this one</t>
 <t id="950004">I wonder what's in here</t>
 <t id="950005">How many more of these am I gonna have to pick up?</t>
 <t id="950006">Sweet</t>
 <t id="950007">Missiles</t>
 <t id="950008">Free upgrades</t>
 <t id="950009">I love free stuff</t>
 <t id="950010">Free is good</t>
 <t id="950011">I wonder what's over there</t>
 <t id="950012">I guess I must've made them angry</t>
 <t id="950013">Hey, you stop shooting I'll get out of here</t>
 <t id="950014">Found another one</t>
 <t id="950015">I wish these fighters would get lost</t>
 <t id="950016">You made a right mess of this M0</t>
 <t id="950017">I'm glad this thing's out of commission</t>
 <t id="950018">I'm glad this thing isn't operational</t>

 <t id="350325">You think you're a tough guy. Let's see how tough you are with a plasmabolt up your bastu.</t>
 <t id="350326">Try talking tough with no oxygen.</t>
 <t id="350327">I know where you live.</t>
 <t id="350329">You think you clever? You think I can't find out?</t>
 <t id="350330">Hey, little woman, shouldn't you be at home with the husband?</t>
 <t id="350332">I'm gonna take you I'm gonna feed your entrails to a split rani, I'm going to gut you from one side to another, I'm going to...</t>
 <t id="350334">What do I pay you guys for? Shoot them down.</t>

 <t id="350336">What do you want?</t>
 <t id="350338">Who the craz is Dogun?</t>
 <t id="350340">You ain't getting nothing of mine.</t>
 <t id="350342">I look like a charity shop? I'd fly this ship up my bastu before I give you anything.</t>
 <t id="350344">You shoot my ship, you put up with my talk.</t>
 <t id="350757">Take the stinkin' crystal. But know this, Don Tony's got you marked.</t>
 <t id="450001">Hey, Yaki eat this!</t>

 <t id="450004">I look stupid to you? Eat this!</t>
 <t id="450005">You fight like you got no carras!</t>
 <t id="450006">Give me that crystal back!</t>
 <t id="450007">You take my daughter you die!</t>
 <t id="450008">This is for Miria, you slugtugging rephead!</t>
 <t id="450009">You mess with Marani, you die by Marani hand.</t>
 <t id="450012">If you hurt her, I'll feed you and your family to the fishes.</t>
 <t id="450013">What? The Crystal not enough, you have to take my daughter too?</t>
 <t id="450015">You're brave enough with a friend, let's see how tough you are on your own.</t>
 <t id="450101">You don't getaway that easy, you lousy Yaki. You and me got business.</t>
 <t id="450301">You think you a tough guy? You sentence a little girl to death and you tough, huh?</t>
 <t id="450303">Listen, Yaki scum, maybe we can make a deal? You, I spit at you, I don't give a bowl full of craz for you, but my daughter, she never do nothing wrong. So, you take Don Marani and you let her go. You hear me?!</t>
 <t id="450305">You don't have the Stone? That means they'll kill her! They kill my beautiful, little girl. And that's your fault you lousy rat, so you'd better help. You owe me. And you help me, I help you teach them a lesson for making you look a dimwad. The Don knows things about the Yaki.</t>
 <t id="450307">Sure. You get my daughter, my beautiful little girl, I tell you all about them.</t>
 <t id="463801">It's you.</t>
 <t id="463803">You might've saved my daughter, but if you laid one finger...</t>
 <t id="463805">(Calm) One finger... My contacts they found the factory. They also find these Yaki scum want two more crystals. You stop them. You mess them up? That's good with me.</t>
 <t id="463808">I just got you home, Miria.</t>
 <t id="463813">You lay one finger. One finger....</t>
 <t id="730502">We're not here for games, Miria. Follow us back to my station.</t>
 <t id="730601">Where you going, space cadet? How far you think you going to get without our help?</t>
 <t id="730904">You're just a business deal, so don't go getting no big ideas.</t>
 <t id="730907">Who's that?</t>
 <t id="740008">JB's the expert on stealing crystals.</t>
 <t id="740012">You gonna trust him? He got a lot of my friends dead!</t>
 <t id="740016">Then we attach a tracker. Get this thing once they get where they're going. I'd do it for you, (pointed) but my best man got killed.</t>
 <t id="740018">Fly the drone in along the ship. You gotta land in the right place or they'll detect you.</t>
 <t id="740133">Signal's coming through strong.</t>
 <t id="750001">...So, where is this installation?</t>
 <t id="750003">Sure, (of) course. You know you get caught in Paranid space they've gonna use your insides for table decorations.</t>
 <t id="750210">And you better look after that ship.</t>
 <t id="750420">How you get to be so famous, when you such a dimwad? Get over here you carrasucking rephead.</t>

 <t id="810004">You don't find Miria, we got nothing to talk about.</t>
 <t id="810005">You go find my daughter, or I fry your bastu!</t>
 <t id="810007">Miria better be all right. Better than all right, or I scrape your eyes out with a spoon. But you need credits, you do this for Don Tony.</t>
 <t id="810008">I'll help you cos it make Miria happy. You make Miria unhappy, you spend your life eating through a straw. Try this for credits.</t>
 <t id="810009">You take care of my daughter, I take care of you, sending details.</t>

 <t id="810011">So, you need the Don Tony? Okay, I got just the thing. Sending details.</t>
 <t id="810012">You need a little money, I need a little help, here's the details.</t>

 <t id="810014">A little job for a little man, here you go.</t>

 <t id="810016">Listen, you finish one thing then you do the next. Resending details.</t>
 <t id="810017">I look like an employment service? I don't got nothing for you.</t>
 <t id="810018">I got better things to do than talk to you right now. I'm not interested.</t>
 <t id="810019">I take care of business myself. I got nothing for you.</t>
 <t id="810020">The amount of heat you got on you, you come here? I don't deal with no dimwad craz that gets so well known to the law.</t>
 <t id="810021">I look like your uncle? You want the job - do it. You don wan it then don't waste my time.</t>
 <t id="810022">I don't have time for no babysitting, go look yourself.</t>

 <t id="2130">You took your time!</t>
 <t id="2131">Thanks. You now in my good books.</t>
 <t id="2140">We're taking too much damage, we've got to...</t>
 <t id="2141">Shields gone! I'm going to...</t>
 <t id="2142">They've got a lock on me, I...</t>
 <t id="2150">I'm a bit busy here, JB!!!</t>
 <t id="2151">I not got time, JB!</t>
 <t id="2160">You'll need an upgrade to your lasers.</t>
 <t id="2161">You're going to need better weaponry than that!</t>
 <t id="2162">Those lasers wouldn't hurt a spacefly. Time for an upgrade.</t>
 <t id="2170">You'll need more cargo space.</t>
 <t id="2171">You haven't enough cargo space.</t>
 <t id="2180">I get some more missiles, JB, bigger ones.</t>
 <t id="2181">Those toy missiles? You'll need an upgrade!</t>
 <t id="2190">Those shields wouldn't protect you from a rainstorm.</t>
 <t id="2191">You need better shields.</t>
 <t id="2192">Annoying as you can be, I'd like you around for a while longer. You're going to have to upgrade those shields.</t>
 <t id="2200">You'd better get your ship repaired.</t>
 <t id="2201">That hull's looking a bit second-hand, you'd better get it repaired.</t>
 <t id="2202">There's a lot of damage, you'd better get that ship repaired.</t>
 <t id="2203">You'll need repairs before you go anywhere.</t>
 <t id="2207">No cargo space. Bad weaponry. Lots of damage. You need a new ship or a complete overhaul.</t>
 <t id="2208">That ship's a mess, you need a complete upgrade.</t>
 <t id="2209">That ship's had it, it'll need repairs and upgrades.</t>
 <t id="2210">You're going to need a fighter for this.</t>
 <t id="2220">You're going to need a bigger ship.</t>

 <t id="463601">Who are you? Did my poppa send you?</t>
 <t id="463603">JB? Is that the one who rescued us? Thank you, you saved my life.</t>
 <t id="463607">My poppa. He will make sure everyone gets home.</t>
 <t id="463609">My poppa's not like that. Besides, he does anything I ask him. And I'm very grateful to you. Especially you, Mr Pilot, I look forward to meeting you when we land.</t>
 <t id="463704">We should get back to Farnham's Legend. You do want to get me home, don't you?</t>
 <t id="463807">I want to help. I'll go with you, JB.</t>
 <t id="463809">And these Yaki thought they could make a Marani a slave. I want to teach them a lesson. Besides, JB will look after me. Won't you, JB?</t>
 <t id="463811">I get everyone home. I call you when I'm ready.</t>
 <t id="463902">I meet you soon. I comm. when ready.</t>
 <t id="463903">I no ready yet, I tell you when I am!</t>
 <t id="463904">Hey, I got things to do to, you know. Sooner you stop bothering me, sooner I'm ready.</t>
 <t id="463905">You that eager to see me, JB? You give me ten minutes.</t>
 <t id="500002">I am ready, so you meet me at my poppa's place and we go hunt Yaki.</t>
 <t id="500201">Hey, JB. I look like I enjoy hanging around? I'm at my poppa's, so get your sorry Bastu over here.</t>
 <t id="500301">Saya has a lot to teach you about women. You know how long I been waiting?</t>
 <t id="500303">Hey, you really know how to make a girl feel special. I send you information, but you better treat me better. I can help you in all sorts of ways, if I like you.</t>
 <t id="500304">Hey, JB. Nice to see you eager to meet me. You always such a stalker?</t>
 <t id="500501">So? Where we start? Or you gonna make me choose?</t>
 <t id="500503">Better take it easy. They're madder than a bunch of hornets with their tails on fire.</t>
 <t id="500506">Stepping in your poppa's footsteps?</t>
 <t id="500508">Julian Brennan? That M0 was destroyed by Kyle Brennan? Saya, told me. Guess it's not just me who's gotta live with a famous poppa.</t>
 <t id="500510">You saved my universe and all those girls.</t>
 <t id="500512">Hey! Watch it, flyboy!</t>
 <t id="500513">But you wanna save a universe you better upgrade that piece of junk, (un)'less you wanna be space debris.</t>
 <t id="500515">It's nice to know you thinking about me. You wanna tell me what you're thinking, or you wanna draw pictures?</t>
 <t id="500517">I don't know, but I know you keep saying things like that I put your carras in a spice press.</t>
 <t id="500601">You gonna upgrade that ship or just think about it, JB? The Xenon will fry that second-hand spacehulk.</t>
 <t id="500701">That ship should be good enough for the Xenon. If you think you can handle them the way your poppa did.</t>
 <t id="500801">Hey, JB, I thought you ask my poppa for information for a reason. Now, we gonna go, or you gonna sit there springcleaning your joystick?</t>
 <t id="500802">(Ironic) I love a man of action. You better get yourself sorted sometime, JB.</t>
 <t id="500807">Oh good, holiday time for JB. You better bring me a present.</t>
 <t id="500808">And here I was thinking you were some kinda hero.</t>
 <t id="500809">You keep me hanging around much longer, I'm gonna get real bored.</t>
 <t id="510001">Hey, spacebrain, you come here to get into Paranid Prime, or what?</t>
 <t id="510101">You change your mind and want to go visit the Paranid instead?</t>
 <t id="510103">Well, it's simple in a 'no way can you do it' sort of a way. You have to get to a Paranid in Paranid space, but they closed the borders. You can try talking to a border patrol at the 'east' gate, but Paranid are about as friendly as a squash mine.</t>
 <t id="510104">Then we should be in Xenon Sector 101.</t>
 <t id="510105">Then we should be in Olmancketslat's Treaty.</t>
 <t id="510108">Then let's go and meet my contact on the trading station in Emperor Mines.</t>
 <t id="510109">Aren't you supposed to be raising the money?</t>
 <t id="510110">Let's go see if Armanckessilon's still in Elena's Fortune. If there's one thing that'll keep a Paranid waiting it's credits.</t>
 <t id="510111">You think? I mean, we really need that crystal and we only left Armanckessilon in a sector full of Kha'ak. No need to rush back there, really.</t>
 <t id="510120">(Sarcastic) Let me think...Hey, I have an idea, maybe we go talk to my Paranid contact in Emperor Mines? You know? The one I suggest before?</t>
 <t id="510121">Let's talk to my Paranid contact on the trading station. And bring your credits they're the universal language.</t>
 <t id="510130">You got the money, you got the girl, well the Paranid. Now there's a picture I didn't want in my head.</t>
 <t id="510140">Let's go to Elena's Fortune then.</t>
 <t id="510150">Hey, I'm all for keeping Paranid waiting but they go sour faster than a first date in a sewerpit, so let's go see him. He's waiting near the trading station.</t>
 <t id="510156">You think? I mean, we really need that crystal and he was getting on so friendly with the Kha'ak.</t>
 <t id="510170">You not well known enough, you don't get a little more notorious, you don't get onboard. Help out a little and take out some pirates then you can dock. Hey, just make sure they not Marani first.</t>
 <t id="510171">Seems they no like you, you better get friendly with them, or you no able to dock.</t>
 <t id="510201">There's one thing a Paranid like more than anything else and that's showing off his big gun.</t>
 <t id="510302">At least we know the Yaki no have the crystal.</t>
 <t id="510304">I got a contact on the trading station here. He's a Paranid with only two eyes, which in Paranid terms makes him as popular as gas in a spacesuit. This guy'll do anything to get the money for his third eye.</t>
 <t id="510601">Well, that was a pathetic display of machismo, you want to get on now? We go to the Emperor Mine trading station.</t>
 <t id="511101">You scared of Paranid or something? How come you're not going to see my contact?</t>
 <t id="511301">That's my contact - Nolmancketnun.</t>
 <t id="511303">From one two eyed creature to another, you still accept our money though, don't you Nolman?</t>
 <t id="511305">We need to get a message to a Paranid called, Armanckessilon. He has a crystal we want to buy.</t>
 <t id="511307">Do you have that, JB?</t>
 <t id="511310">Hey, you turn up on a first date with no money, you not gonna get to dance and you try to blast your way into Paranid space, you bet Armanckessilon won't sell you the crystal. So, get your skinny hide out raising those credits.</t>
 <t id="511404">You ever met a Paranid worth their own hype? Problem is if Nolman wants that much, Armanckessilon ain't gonna want pocket change.</t>
 <t id="511701">Well, what you wait for? Get the credits and get to him!</t>
 <t id="511802">What are you waiting for? Pocket money? You get flying, you get trading or we're not going to get anywhere.</t>
 <t id="511804">You waiting on a lotto ticket or what? Let's get those credits, flyboy.</t>
 <t id="512103">Play nice. You want the crystal from him remember? You can tell him he's an arrogant baka after you got it.</t>
 <t id="512105">Hey, you good at kissing bastu. Any time you want to come over and kiss...</t>
 <t id="512107">Watch out, JB. Kha'ak incoming.</t>
 <t id="512110">That useless yellow streak's running.</t>
 <t id="512112">Clear those Kha'ak then we able to trade with that no carras Paranid.</t>
 <t id="512113">And more. Looks like they having a party.</t>
 <t id="512202">What is it?</t>
 <t id="512301">Where did it go?</t>
 <t id="512303">You got a fan club you not told me about?</t>
 <t id="512501">Where's he going?</t>
 <t id="512505">His comm's off.</t>
 <t id="512506">What happened?</t>
 <t id="512510">It's not on my scanners.</t>
 <t id="512511">That ship's back!</t>
 <t id="512601">Where are you going, JB? I thought you needed this crystal.</t>
 <t id="513001">One crystal. Why do the Yaki want these things anyway?</t>
 <t id="513003">I wouldn't trust a Yaki with a blunt spoon. Let's get the rest of this stuff and stop them. Which one you wanna get next?</t>
 <t id="513101">Two down, one to go, JB. Let's find out what those damned Yaki got hidden.</t>
 <t id="513201">Two down, one to go, JB. Let's stick it to the Yaki and get that other crystal.</t>
 <t id="513301">Well that's everything. What are you going to do now, JB?</t>
 <t id="513303">You come over all religious?</t>
 <t id="513305">My poppa's been messaging me every three sezuras, I better go see him. We make a good team. You come see me and next time, maybe we make the teamwork a bit more personal. Kouun stopping the Yaki, JB.</t>
 <t id="513402">He's on the trading station in this sector.</t>
 <t id="513403">He's on the trading station in Emperor Mines.</t>
 <t id="513611">You always this decisive?</t>
 <t id="513621">You sure? You don't wanna just go look at them then change your mind again?</t>
 <t id="513631">Saya say you haven't got a girlfriend, that cos you can't make your mind up and you no ask anyone out?</t>
 <t id="520001">I did the Xenon in school. Only seen a couple of them.</t>
 <t id="520003">Xenon came from Earth? Then why so many people wanna go there? Hey, your poppa's from there, yeah? What's he like?</t>
 <t id="520101">You change your mind and want to do the Black crystal first?</t>
 <t id="520103">Then we should be in Emperor Mines.</t>
 <t id="520105">Okay.(This now links into the complete Xenon Mission briefing from D.5.0.05)</t>
 <t id="520202">Nice of you to care about my health, but I don't wait for nobody.</t>
 <t id="520204">I wait, but only if it is because you wish it, not my poppa.</t>
 <t id="520206">Ha! You really think I do it just cos you say? I stay so someone can save your sorry Bastu when you get in trouble.</t>
 <t id="520501">You got the crystal?</t>
 <t id="520503">You gotta get it some time. You gonna upgrade your ship, or try again?</t>
 <t id="520504">You got it?</t>
 <t id="520506">Don't tell me you're giving up. I thought you were a real man. You gonna upgrade your ship, or try again?</t>
 <t id="520507">I come with you. Looking at that crate you got, I think ship salesmen see you coming and rub their hands.</t>
 <t id="520602">You screwed up somewhere. Now get your Bastu in there and don't come back without that crystal!</t>
 <t id="520603">Are you as good as your poppa, or are you gonna run away like a little mouse?</t>
 <t id="520605">You wanna get beat by some little robots?</t>
 <t id="520607">Almost ain't good enough.</t>
 <t id="520701">You have the crystal?</t>
 <t id="520703">About time. You in a hurry to stop the Yaki, or you planning to take the rest of this jazura?</t>
 <t id="520801">Okay, JB - what's next?</t>
 <t id="521202">Where you going? I haven't told you what you need to do!</t>
 <t id="530001">So, flyboy, what you going to do now? You try and get to that station, you're spacedust. Bring a fleet, blow the station up, you don't learn about those fancy weapons. So? Any bright ideas?</t>
 <t id="530003">What?</t>
 <t id="530005">(Put out) Did he? (new plan) And how grateful would you be if I could give you a solution?</t>
 <t id="530009">I didn't ask about the Argon authorities.</t>
 <t id="530011">Nothing. It was just good to see you squirm. Get me 10,000 credits of computer components and meet me in Bala Gi's Joy.</t>
 <t id="530013">That's one word I never hear, now get going!</t>
 <t id="530101">You change your mind and want to go for those disruptor missiles?</t>
 <t id="530106">He'll still help me. Let's get back to him.</t>
 <t id="530110">Then let's talk to my friend on the Quantum Tube Fab in Bala Gi's Joy.</t>
 <t id="530111">Let's talk to my friend on the Quantum Tube Fab.</t>
 <t id="530115">As long as you aren't our secret weapon, cos then even I'm putting money on the Yaki.</t>
 <t id="530116">You wanna look round and see which one of us has a bright idea? Cos I don't see no light filament appearing above your head.</t>
 <t id="530120">Let's pick Jesan up.</t>
 <t id="530130">Let's push those thrusters and head to Olmancketslat's Treaty then.</t>
 <t id="530202">The plan? I'll tell you that when you remember to get hold of those computer components. About 10,000 credits worth.</t>
 <t id="530204">You want to find out more about me, you got to find the courage to ask.</t>
 <t id="530302">There's a computer expert in Bala Gi's Joy. He done some work for us in the past.</t>
 <t id="530304">Let's just say I hope you didn't have savings in the PXK bank.</t>
 <t id="530306">He'll help me. He's on the Quantum Tube Fab, let's dock there.</t>
 <t id="530401">See, that wasn't so hard.</t>
 <t id="530501">Can't you find your way round a system? I'm on the Quantum Tube Fab. You'll find it listed under the confusing name - Quantum Tube Fab.</t>
 <t id="530702">Hi, Jesan. Meet my friend, JB.</t>
 <t id="530704">It's a flying visit. We need help to get some weapons plans off a space station. We brought you some computer components as a little thank you.</t>
 <t id="530706">(Flirting) Of course...(Straight) JB will fly you.</t>
 <t id="530708">Don't worry, you boys will get on just fine.</t>
 <t id="530709">I'll meet you here when you're done. Jesan, you might want to remind JB to check the stuff my poppa sent him. He can get a bit lost sometimes.</t>
 <t id="530808">That was a real no carras move back there, JB, you want to do this or no?</t>
 <t id="531101">Did JB behave himself?</t>
 <t id="531103">I'm very grateful, Jesan.</t>
 <t id="531105">Soon, soon. We got some other business to see too now. Oh, and Jesan, that stuff under your bed...I hope your mama never finds out about it. Come on JB.</t>
 <t id="531304">Yeah, but he made sure you had a suit. You take me somewhere I don wanna go you gonna get transported somewhere without your head, and that's if you get lucky.</t>
 <t id="531401">I thought you were taking those plans to Ban Danna? I've never seen Argon One. Shimatta, it's been a long time since I saw Argon Prime. We have a few difficulties with the authorities.</t>
 <t id="531601">You get the plans?</t>
 <t id="531603">Okay, we'll see you later, Jesan.</t>
 <t id="531605">So, what do you want to do now?</t>
 <t id="531701">Hi, Jesan.</t>
 <t id="531703">Now play fair, both of you.</t>
 <t id="531802">This time I say it real slow so you can understand. Computer components worth 10,000 credits. That okay, or you want me to write it on your head in BIG letters?</t>
 <t id="531804">If it didn't mean I have to wash them I'd put them straight up your bastu, to see if that help you remember. We go to the Quantum Tube Fab in Bala Gi's Joy. Okay?</t>
 <t id="531808">Can you move nearer the comm, I wanna see if your mama had to tattoo your name on your forehead for you. He's on the Quantum Tube Fab in Bala Gi's Joy! You better get it together before you try and visit those Yaki again.</t>
 <t id="531809">You still got those components I asked you to get?</t>
 <t id="531811">Yes.</t>
 <t id="531813">Yes.</t>
 <t id="531815">Then you better get some more and meet me back here you spacebrain.</t>
 <t id="540202">Afraid I'll tempt some spacehappy fleetboys into a life of piracy?</t>
 <t id="540301">Okay, JB - what's next?</t>
 <t id="540401">We still gotta go pay those Xenon a visit. You ready for that?</t>
 <t id="540501">We still gotta go get the crystal from those happy Paranid.</t>
 <t id="550520">You wanna check your ship see if you got the rest of the things as well?</t>
 <t id="550522">Pity, we could've found some other way to spend the time. So, which one you wanna get now?</t>
 <t id="730501">You're a man who takes his time. (Flirty) You take your time over everything?</t>
 <t id="730901">Looks like you've lost your pursuers.</t>
 <t id="730903">Poppa's decided to go straight. He talked to Ban Danna, and he said he help us if we help you.</t>
 <t id="730905">You'll hand him over to me! Until then...we've sorted out fake ID for you, so where we headed?</t>
 <t id="740007">Convoys are our speciality. Poppa?</t>
 <t id="740009">(reproving) Poppa.</t>
 <t id="740010">I transfer back to my ship.</t>
 <t id="740019">They're coming through. Deploying drone.</t>
 <t id="740101">You gotta dodge those sensors, JB</t>
 <t id="740102">They're firing!</t>
 <t id="740105">They've lost it.</t>
 <t id="740106">Good flying, they just see a blip and think it's space debris.</t>
 <t id="740107">You dodged them.</t>
 <t id="740108">Like candy from the baby, yes?</t>
 <t id="740109">They got it. Deploying another one.</t>
 <t id="740110">You shoulda met Alfredo, he was much better.</t>
 <t id="740111">Alfredo would be laughing right now. Sending in another drone.</t>
 <t id="740112">You supposed to be landing the drone, yes? No getting it shot.</t>
 <t id="740113">The drone's taking too much damage!</t>
 <t id="740114">Next shot and you've had it!</t>
 <t id="740115">You trying to get the drone destroyed?</t>
 <t id="740116">Don't let it get shot no more!</t>
 <t id="740117">You got 100 metres and closing.</t>
 <t id="740118">Fifty meters.</t>
 <t id="740119">Twenty metres.</t>
 <t id="740120">Put it down there.</t>
 <t id="740121">Land it, JB!</t>
 <t id="740122">Typical man! Couldn't find the spot even when it was painted!</t>
 <t id="740123">You missed it, try again!</t>
 <t id="740124">Go left!</t>
 <t id="740125">Go right!</t>
 <t id="740126">Left!</t>
 <t id="740127">Right!</t>
 <t id="740128">You gone too far!</t>
 <t id="740129">Go back!</t>
 <t id="740130">They scanning us, you better move!</t>
 <t id="740131">You're in the scanning beam.</t>
 <t id="740132">That's it you got it!</t>
 <t id="740135">We sit back and follow them now.</t>
 <t id="740136">You getting too close, JB, we got a tracker on there so you no have to fly that close!</t>
 <t id="740301">Well, we miss that one. Let's get back to the gate before the next one comes through.</t>
 <t id="740302">Over here, dimwad. You no find gate, no wonder you can't land the drone.</t>
 <t id="740303">That look like a gate to you? Get over here!</t>
 <t id="740401">I think you hit the Seed.</t>
 <t id="740501">Signal firm.</t>
 <t id="740502">I'm checking. Got them, they're in Heretic's End.</t>
 <t id="740601">It's a good job you stop being a pirate. You lousy at it.</t>
 <t id="740603">Okay, we try...again.</t>
 <t id="740604">It's a good job they got a lot of ships.</t>
 <t id="741109">They Paranids, who knows if they know?!</t>
 <t id="750005">You gonna need a ship with a jump drive, we can't go gate to gate. We can pick one up at our base.</t>
 <t id="750201">JB, you take this ship. Ion and Kyle, you go with Al.</t>
 <t id="750209">Expensive. Now let's get to Duke's Domain.</t>
 <t id="750302">Nice steal, but it's not what we need.</t>
 <t id="750401">This should be far enough out for their system sensors not to pick us up.</t>
 <t id="750403">You want we fly into the middle of the system and say hi? We wait and a ship will come.</t>
 <t id="750405">Standard rule of military tactics, always send patrols to faraway lonely places where they can be ambushed. We capture the ship then use its ID to get into the system. That little ship we picked up that stops them telling anyone what we're doing.</t>
 <t id="750406">Everyone think being a pirate is such an exciting life. Most of it you sit on your bastu waiting. You get good at solitaire. You ever wanna play me at solitaire, I beat your bastu.</t>
 <t id="750408">Okay, JB, go catch our fish. You got ten kilometres before he gets out of our jamming range.</t>
 <t id="750409">Keep hitting him, take his shields out.</t>
 <t id="750410">It's one little patrol ship, JB!</t>
 <t id="750411">Eight kilometres. You better pick it up before he gets out of jamming range.</t>
 <t id="750412">You almost out of space!</t>
 <t id="750413">He getaway, we gonna have the whole Paranid fleet on our head!</t>
 <t id="750414">You get caught this for nothing, you bastu!</t>
 <t id="750415">Okay, now, quick, we head out to the system rim.</t>
 <t id="750417">So we don't get seen and we don't die, that make sense?</t>
 <t id="750418">Keep up, JB.</t>
 <t id="750419">You going the wrong way, you baka.</t>
 <t id="750501">Okay, the rest of you guys, jump this system and we call you when we need you.</t>
 <t id="750504">You got a life? When did that happen?</t>
 <t id="750601">Where are you going, JB?</t>
 <t id="750602">You think we risked everything so you could go sightseeing?</t>
 <t id="750603">You wanna get your life back then you have to get your bastu back in that system.</t>
 <t id="750604">This installation so big it goes into a different system, or you get lost again?</t>
 <t id="750701">He's calling for help. We gotta jump out of here, or the whole Paranid Fleet will be on us.</t>
 <t id="750702">Let's just put that down as you distracting the fleet, hey, JB and let's go again.</t>
 <t id="750705">Okay, same play, we wait for a ship. You shoot his shields down, you steal the ship.</t>
 <t id="750706">You gotta hit those shields, make him think he's gonna be destroyed, then he'll ditch the ship, yeah?</t>
 <t id="750707">You trying to train the Paranid Fleet? Steal the ship, JB!</t>
 <t id="750708">We're jamming him, go!</t>
 <t id="750801">Okay, I'm running low on power, let's jump back to Farnham's Legend, take a break and come back again.</t>
 <t id="750901">Okay, JB, let's try again.</t>
 <t id="751001">This installation invisible or something? Cos I see nothing.</t>
 <t id="751003">How do you find a cloaking device?</t>
 <t id="751005">Try the Hornets, those are the best for hitting stations.</t>
 <t id="751006">I think they just realise we not Paranids. (We see some Paranid ships coming in on an intercept) You fly, I shoot.</t>
 <t id="751008">Take that Paranid baka ne!</t>
 <t id="751009">Call yourself a man?</t>
 <t id="751011">Well, I'm sorry, who made you an Argonopedia? (more firing) Call yourself a Paranid?!</t>
 <t id="751012">Who's lower life now?</t>
 <t id="751013">You wanna use those three eyes, well then dodge this! (more firing)</t>
 <t id="751014">You shooting those power things, or just taking pictures?</t>
 <t id="751015">Ha ha! What you think of the Pontifex Maximus Paranidia now, ey?</t>
 <t id="751016">You wanna keep a secret Paranid? You want a secret you go to a Marani!</t>
 <t id="751018">Only...I could be lying! Take this from the Yaki!</t>
 <t id="751019">Come on, JB, get rid of that cloak!</t>
 <t id="751020">Power down 50%. You hit another two and the cloak will be gone!</t>
 <t id="751021">Power's down. Hit some more.</t>
 <t id="751022">Shoot it, JB!</t>
 <t id="751023">You wanna shoot it or kiss it? Fire, JB!</t>
 <t id="751024">Hit one more power thing and it's gone! We see your secrets now Paranid!</t>
 <t id="751025">You hit those power things, I take care of these rectemites.</t>
 <t id="751026">Keep shooting the station, these guys are mine.</t>
 <t id="751027">You wanna do this before we run out of shields and die, JB?</t>
 <t id="751102">I thought no one knew how the gates worked.</t>
 <t id="751105">There's a convoy forming, they on the move.</t>
 <t id="751107">They're heading for the North gate. We can jump sectors and get ahead of them. I'll call the others.</t>
 <t id="751404">Poppa.</t>
 <t id="760001">The tracker got them Paranid out on West side.</t>
 <t id="760101">What are they doing?</t>
 <t id="760107">Since when did that stop a Paranid?</t>
 <t id="760110">They losing it!</t>
 <t id="760126">Where you want this?</t>
 <t id="760134">We've got more problems than that.</t>
 <t id="760140">You better hurry, JB, it's looking bad out here.</t>
 <t id="760141">We got a gateship, powering up.</t>
 <t id="760201">That thing's interfering with the gate. We don't get this sorted we'll be trapped here.</t>
 <t id="800000">JB!</t>
 <t id="800002">Just shoot them!</t>
 <t id="800003">This thing flies like a pregnant mosscow.</t>
 <t id="800004">Any chance you could hit them before next jazura?!</t>
 <t id="800005">I'd stand more chance being rescued by a Yaki!</t>
 <t id="800007">There are too many of them. We're Bonnismeat.</t>
 <t id="800008">When are these Paranid gonna notice we on their side?!</t>
 <t id="800010">Concentrate on the Kha'ak you baka ne!</t>
 <t id="800011">I always say Paranid were born with their head up their bastu.</t>
 <t id="800026">This is not looking so good.</t>
 <t id="800033">Poppa, you say thank you, properly!</t>
 <t id="800105">It look like you get here just in time.</t>
 <t id="800117">Bit late for that right now.</t>
 <t id="800118">You stop being a pirate and suddenly everyone want to kill you.</t>
 <t id="800123">There's another wave of them</t>
 <t id="800140">They've gone suicidal! Hey! You want to crash, go play with an asteroid!</t>
 <t id="800302">JB, the station.</t>
 <t id="800408">You bet your bastu!</t>
 <t id="800428">Hey? JB where are you? You gonna keep me waiting again? Get your bastu down here so we can go to the party.</t>
 <t id="800431">Are you okay, Julian?</t>
 <t id="810025">JB, I knew you'd come see me.</t>
 <t id="810026">It's for me poppa, so keep you nose out! I got something you can do for me, JB.</t>
 <t id="810027">I knew you'd want to make me happy. I got a job that will make me very happy.</t>
 <t id="810028">I can't talk right now, Poppa's listening. You better go.</t>
 <t id="810029">You figure that out yourself, JB. I'm paying you to do the job, go do it.</t>
 <t id="810030">That's for me to know and you to find out, bye, JB</t>
 <t id="902044">Check your 'starmap'.</t>
 <t id="902221">You get that crystal, I give you an extra prize.</t>
 <t id="902223">Yeah. I won't frag your useless Bastu.</t>
 <t id="902226">You ask me if I got a sister, I take your eyes out with a spoon.</t>
 <t id="902227">You could trade, or race, or my father might have some work you could do. Just get off your bastu and do something!</t>
 <t id="902404">I'm so glad I came to help.</t>
 <t id="902405">You really have to work on your charm you know.</t>
 <t id="902406">They craz sucking lowcrawlers. Lousy cheating pirate wasters. They no worth the breath to say their stinkin' name.</t>
 <t id="902407">Several million credits to some collectors.</t>
 <t id="902408">You wait, you find out.</t>
 <t id="902409">Hey, you know how many people take the pizola out of programmers? You get shot at, he plays games and eats pizza all day, which one sounds like the idiot now?</t>
 <t id="902410">Only the things they found out about and that isn't close to what he's done. One day he'll stop being a crime boss. Then he'll be a real nightmare. Bazani, I gotta get my own place!</t>
 <t id="902411">I got a list. Why you want to be on it?</t>
 <t id="902413">A two eyed Paranid. Won't tell me how he lost the other eye, but he'll do anything for the credits to get it back. And when I say anything, I don't want you getting the wrong idea. That sort of picture in your head will get you in trouble.</t>

 <t id="1220">Okay, okay, let's get this clear. I got other things to do than talk to rectemites like you.</t>
 <t id="2000">Yeah.</t>
 <t id="2010">No.</t>
 <t id="2070">Try checking your gravidar, dimwad, we've got company!</t>
 <t id="2071">Watch out!</t>
 <t id="2072">You keep flying this badly, we're history.</t>
 <t id="2140">Great you just about got us killed...</t>
 <t id="2141">Shields gone! Game over...</t>
 <t id="2290">(Instead of yawn)Doo, doo, doo.</t>
 <t id="530701">Miria!</t>
 <t id="530703">(Dismissive) Hi. (Excited again) So, how long you here for, Miria?</t>
 <t id="530705">You know it's not computer components I'm interested in. Hey, the plans'll be easy. We'll have to go in my ship though; it's the only one with the right equipment. And, er, (hopeful) I'll need a pilot.</t>
 <t id="530707">(Disappointed) Oh.</t>
 <t id="530801">Okay, okay, I thought this pirate station was in Olmancketslat's Treaty, right?</t>
 <t id="530802">Okay, okay you need a map? This sure isn't Olmancketslat's Treaty.</t>
 <t id="530804">Okay, okay. Enjoy the view on your own time. Get back on course, or I'm chucking you overboard.</t>
 <t id="530805">You really want to see more of space? Okay...let me help you see it real close up. (Jesan then spaces the player)</t>
 <t id="530806">I'll say hi to Miria for you Chickeeboy.</t>
 <t id="530807">Surprised you came back, I've seen Bonnis with more guts.</t>
 <t id="530902">Okay, okay. Scanning factory. Take it slow, don't look suspicious.</t>
 <t id="530904">(Ignoring him and scanning) Okay...okay...they're shielded, but you see that channel I've marked? We get close to that we can run a scan.</t>
 <t id="530906">I'm going to need at least 60 seconds and don't go faster that 120 m/s or I won't be able to hold the lock.</t>
 <t id="530909">This ship gets damaged, you get damaged, okay?</t>
 <t id="530910">You wearing a blindfold up there?</t>
 <t id="530911">This is my ship. Remember that, or you're floating home.</t>
 <t id="530912">Okay...okay, I'm getting something.</t>
 <t id="530913">Keep it close.</t>
 <t id="530915">Okay, okay, I'm getting in.</t>
 <t id="530916">Keep it steady.</t>
 <t id="530918">I've lost it. Wish Miria could see what a dimwad you are.</t>
 <t id="530919">Okay, okay, I thought you said you were a pilot.</t>
 <t id="530920">Lost it again. No faster than 120m/s for sixty seconds, Dimwad!</t>
 <t id="530921">If Miria was flying, we'd've done it by now! Do it again.</t>
 <t id="530922">Space is this big and still you hit something?</t>
 <t id="530923">Just follow the markers, okay, space monkey?</t>
 <t id="530924">Okay, okay, sixty seconds at 120, follow the markers.</t>
 <t id="530925">Hey, I don't mind telling Miria that you couldn't do one simple thing. Fly the channel and try not to crash.</t>
 <t id="530926">Hold it steady.</t>
 <t id="530928">It's hard to concentrate with that laser tower shooting at us.</t>
 <t id="530929">Okay, okay, any chance you could stop getting my ship shot up?</t>
 <t id="530930">Okay, okay, just follow the markers.</t>
 <t id="530931">Okay, okay, just follow the groove.</t>
 <t id="530932">Stop shaking the ship.</t>
 <t id="530933">I got a stream. Hold it for sixty seconds.</t>
 <t id="530934">Just another twenty seconds.</t>
 <t id="530935">Just thirty seconds.</t>
 <t id="530936">Ten seconds!</t>
 <t id="530937">Five.</t>
 <t id="530938">You're going too fast!</t>
 <t id="530939">Slow down!! I'm losing it!</t>
 <t id="531005">I've got it! Get us out of here and back to my station.</t>
 <t id="531102">You're a better pilot. This guy should be flying passenger routes.</t>
 <t id="531104">When will I see you again?</t>
 <t id="531301">Let's stick to the mission? It's Miria I'm doing a favour for, so get back on track.</t>
 <t id="531302">I'm only doing this for Miria, and I won't think twice about spacing you and explaining the accident.</t>
 <t id="531501">Okay, my base is Bala Gi's Joy. You were there, remember?</t>
 <t id="531502">You want me to draw you a map to Bala Gi's Joy? I've got some crayons somewhere.</t>
 <t id="531503">Okay, okay, look, much as I like your company, I'd rather get back to Miria.</t>
 <t id="531604">I'll look forward to it. Particularly more time with Mr 'can't follow instructions' here. He's bags of fun.</t>
 <t id="531702">Miria! Oh, you brought company again.</t>
 <t id="531901">If I'd really wanted your sweaty bastu on my ship I'd've bought some air fresheners and sent you an invite. Let's get home and you can get lost on your own time.</t>
 <t id="531902">Bad enough you're hanging around Miria let alone my ship. Turn this baby around, point it at home and get out of my life.</t>
 <t id="531903">You might have nothing better to do, but I've got a girl I want to get back to. Ejector activated....</t>

Senator McCarthy organised it herself. (Beat) He'll be back you know. As soon as he's finished talking to Earth.</t>
 <t id="800425">Ban hasn't forgotten. He thinks we can find a way to communicate with the Kha'ak and stop this properly and we've got people analysing Sargon's projector to see what we can find out. But in the meantime, everyone gets to live in peace that bit longer because of you.</t>
 <t id="800427">Glad you remembered. Thought you might've got too important to talk to us.</t>
 <t id="800434">Time to go home?</t>

 <t id="410101">This is where Thomus was last. He is, well, he is rather a recluse. However, there is a friend of Thomus's on the Trading Station we'll have to talk to him to find out where Thomus is.</t>
 <t id="610001">Ion says that the Seed can be found inside an asteroid in Priest Rings. However, as the Paranid borders are still closed, only Paranid can build mines there. You'll have to find a way to persuade someone to help you.</t>
 <t id="610002">Once you have, you will need to build a super-factory, the details of which are attached to this message. All the information we have about the seed is that it is some sort of high energy vortex. A vortex powerful enough to tear a hole in space, so be cautious!</t>
 <t id="610003">Ion has given this information very easily and we know nothing of this creature who he claims tricked him, so be wary, Julian. I feel in my heart that this Sargon cannot be Sohnen, they were peaceful and there are no reports of them manipulating other races. May you tread the path of wisdom with your eyes open.</t>
 <t id="610007">Once you have, you will need to build a superfactory. The components would be...</t>

 <t id="350002">Good, good. We must retrieve the crystal...</t>
 <t id="350004">Can you think of anyone better...?</t>
 <t id="350005">Do not exert yourself, Brennansama.</t>
 <t id="350007">My name is Ion (pronounced eon). Noah asked me to find you.</t>
 <t id="350009">Yes, yes, that was most regrettable ...Your friend Saya is here with your ship, so as soon as you are well you may find the person who did this.</t>
 <t id="350102">The police say that a pirate called Don Tony Marani took the stone. His ship - the Talon - is docked in Farnham's Legend for repairs. It has a jump drive but we have given Saya Khosama a jump scanner, so if he refuses to surrender the crystal you can follow him. When you have the crystal I will meet you. May peace find and comfort you.</t>
 <t id="551004">You're making a big mistake, Noah. You should let me go.</t>
 <t id="551006">I wouldn't expect you to believe. You wouldn't even believe your father.</t>
 <t id="551008">And you expect me to believe that?</t>
 <t id="551011">Earth would change all our lives.</t>
 <t id="551013">He said he knows how to, he understood the projector! (Grasping a chance for redemption) But he still needs something. A seed, that's what makes the jump events. He found one the ancients left in some sort of installation. I meant no harm, Noah, you must believe that. It was Earth!</t>
 <t id="551015">No...</t>
 <t id="551016">He said his name was Sargon. A Sohnen. He told me how the projector worked and that the other crystals would programme the jump event. That it would take us there - to Earth. You have to see, Noah, all these years!</t>
 <t id="760118">The machine is programmed to send the event to Sargon's world. I have no reference to change the co-ordinates.</t>
 <t id="760123">What is it?</t>
 <t id="760125">It will take me several minutes to programme it.</t>

 <t id="710801">Okay, pilot. We have to get back and talk to Ban Danna.</t>
 <t id="710803">We got answers.</t>

 <t id="710820">Come on pilot, they need help.</t>
 <t id="710902">(Wearied) Let's get back to Argon.</t>
 <t id="710904">Julian...</t>
 <t id="710906">Whatever you want.</t>
 <t id="710908">I don't think so.</t>
 <t id="710910">And you think that's my fault? That the death of your friend, Brett...</t>
 <t id="710912">You've lost a friend, how would you feel if someone threatened to take everything?</t>
 <t id="710914">Strange though, isn't it? We'd never heard of them then they arrive and start destroying everything?</t>
 <t id="710916">Let's get back to Ban Danna.</t>
 <t id="710918">And how many people have you killed to defend what matters to you? However you justify it, they're still dead.</t>
 <t id="711301">Julian, we need to talk to Ban Danna as soon as possible. That and...it's about time we met properly, don't you think?</t>
 <t id="711403">Julian, leave them, this is only making things worse.</t>
 <t id="720201">Not just it. The asteroid too. The Kha'ak had been alone throughout time then the Gunner crashed straight through the middle of their hive systems. They followed it, found us and began to learn about the other life out here. And that was okay, because the other life didn't know they existed.</t>
 <t id="720203">They didn't see a difference between the races. Not at first anyway. Then the Paranid started sending recon missions into Kha'ak space. They didn't find the Kha'ak homeworld, but they did find what they were looking for.</t>
 <t id="720208">I agree.</t>
 <t id="720214">The Paranid sent recon in. They must have detected some of the Kha'ak scoutships. The Kha'ak saw this recon as a threat.</t>
 <t id="720217">It's always been around in small quantities, but now it's being mined in massive amounts with ships constantly going into Kha'ak space. There's a simple reason we can't find their homeworld. We're stealing what's left of it.</t>
 <t id="720218">I thought the Gunner might contain starcharts that could help us find Earth. It turns out I wasn't the only one looking for the ship.</t>
 <t id="730018">Why've they released us, Julian?</t>
 <t id="730020">Face the politicians, or make a break for it?</t>
 <t id="730022">So, are you going to fly this bucket, or shall I?</t>
 <t id="730024">Okay, so you fly, I'll fix it.</t>
 <t id="730302">(audio only) It's been taken off line. It'll take me a minute to reroute it.</t>
 <t id="730304">Don't kill any of them, they're on our side remember?!</t>
 <t id="730305">More ships coming in, stay sharp up there.</t>
 <t id="730307">Have you seen the ships they've blocked it with? It's suicide! Give me a moment more, the drive will be online.</t>
 <t id="730315">I'm going to need another minute.</t>
 <t id="730316">I'm almost there.</t>
 <t id="730318">I'm fixing a jump drive not a broken power socket!</t>
 <t id="730320">Then fly evasive.</t>
 <t id="730322">I'm on the last bit now.</t>
 <t id="730324">You're a prisoner that's stolen a ship, what did you expect them to do?</t>
 <t id="730325">Another few seconds.</t>
 <t id="730327">I've got it! Hit the jump button!</t>
 <t id="730330">Ah, that'll be the...one second.</t>
 <t id="730332">(Pause) That's it try it now!</t>
 <t id="730349">Where are we going to jump to, Julian?</t>
 <t id="730351">I hope he knows what he's saying the Don's got a pretty vicious reputation.</t>
 <t id="750203">I wish I could say the same, Ion. The man who named the Kha'ak, someone with the background you have then...Julian told me about Dogun.</t>
 <t id="750205">Instead he died to save another.</t>
 <t id="750421">Come on, Julian, we don't want to get caught.</t>
 <t id="750502">Good luck, Julian.</t>
 <t id="760105">(Disgusted) It's all about credits.</t>
 <t id="760114">We'll go for the gates. You take Ion where he needs to go. He's coming across, now.</t>
 <t id="760129">One step ahead of you.</t>
 <t id="760131">Only one way to find out. See you on the other side.</t>
 <t id="760202">My jump drive's offline.</t>
 <t id="800407">Earth fleet to Argon One. May we be of assistance?</t>
 <t id="800416">Julian will join you shortly. I'm returning to Earth. Hopefully I can persuade them to open up contact with us, but they're highly suspicious so it could take some time. Kyle out.</t>

 <t id="320400">Entering Ringo Moon.</t>
 <t id="320402">Dogun, you never say it's quiet in space.</t>
 <t id="320404">They're your fault, Dogun, that's what they are! JB, we've got company!</t>
 <t id="320406">You believe him?</t>
 <t id="320408">Me neither. Frag him.</t>
 <t id="320409">They're pirates, JB. Recognise any of them?</t>
 <t id="320411">Oh, good. Are they nice pirates?</t>
 <t id="320413">Come on, JB, we're getting fried here.</t>
 <t id="320414">Is this thing insured, Dogun?</t>
 <t id="320415">This ship's one of a kind, JB, Noah's not going to be pleased if you let it get blown up. Come to that, neither am I!</t>
 <t id="320416">Try using the rapid impulse laser, JB.</t>
 <t id="320417">Try switching weapons, JB.</t>
 <t id="320418">These guys are good</t>
 <t id="320419">I can't hold them off. There are too many of them!</t>
 <t id="320420">Shields are low. You're going to have to finish these guys off or we're floating home.</t>
 <t id="320421">Hang on!</t>
 <t id="320423">Let's see if we can shake these guys.</t>
 <t id="320424">Here we go!</t>
 <t id="320426">You prefer I let them shoot us?</t>
 <t id="320428">Do I look like a priest?</t>
 <t id="320430">Switch off your shields and prepare to be fragged.</t>
 <t id="320432">Get bent.</t>
 <t id="320433">Hey, pirate boy, you forgot your parrot.</t>
 <t id="320438">Where's there, Dogun?!!</t>
 <t id="320440">We'll have some universal peace. Just as soon as JB's blown these Baka Ne to bits.</t>
 <t id="320442">Gate coming up.</t>
 <t id="320445">Try using the flak cannon.</t>
 <t id="320501">We're taking too much damage, we've got to...</t>
 <t id="320502">Shields gone! We're...</t>
 <t id="320503">Reactor critical! It's going to...</t>
 <t id="320601">Great shooting!</t>
 <t id="320603">No, Dogun, not there, that's the...</t>
 <t id="320605">...control panel. (Resigned) You'd better clean that up. I'm bringing us in to land. Re-entry in ten.</t>
 <t id="350011">I don't give a flying shunt about the equipment! Is he all right?</t>
 <t id="350015">Then you'd better get Julian back on his feet and fast.</t>
 <t id="350016">Are you okay, JB?</t>
 <t id="350018">As long as you're okay, we'd better find this crystal. If this weapon's as powerful as Ion says...</t>
 <t id="350020">Ion's fitted your ship with a jump drive; he said you'd need it.</t>
 <t id="350022">Ion says you'll need a jump drive, but that M5's way too small. Get yourself another ship and meet me at the trading station in this sector when you're ready.</t>
 <t id="350023">Yeah. As if the Kha'ak weren't giving us enough to worry about.</t>
 <t id="350025">You're going to need bigger guns, JB. Even without us looking for trouble there are enough pirates and Kha'ak out there. Pick up something with more firepower and meet me back here.</t>
 <t id="350027">Ion thinks we'll need about seventy units worth of power cells if we are to keep up with the Talon. Pick them up and meet me here.</t>
 <t id="350028">Ion thinks we'll need a jump drive and seventy units worth of power cells to keep up with the Talon, but your ship's too small. Get a bigger ship, bring it here and we'll fit what you need.</t>
 <t id="350029">Ion thinks we'll need a jump drive and seventy units worth of power cells to keep up with the Talon, but you haven't enough cargo space, clear things out or get a bigger ship and we'll fit what you need.</t>
 <t id="350201">According to Ion, the Don's ship is docked at a pirate station to the West.</t>
 <t id="350202">Meet me in Farnham's Legend.</t>
 <t id="350300">That must be the Talon. It's damaged all right.</t>
 <t id="350301">Shame, I was hoping he'd hang around to be friends.</t>
 <t id="350304">Maybe we should've asked for more than just the crystal.</t>
 <t id="350306">Sure! I was born stupid. Let's take these pirates out.</t>
 <t id="350307">He's engaging his Jump-drive. I'm getting a lock...</t>
 <t id="350308">Got it! Sending you the co-ordinates. Let's get after him!</t>
 <t id="350312">There he is, let's get after him.</t>
 <t id="350314">I think he's heading to the North gate.</t>
 <t id="350315">He's going to the South.</t>
 <t id="350316">I've got him on scanner to the West.</t>
 <t id="350317">I'm tracking him to the East.</t>
 <t id="350318">Quick he's heading out of the sector.</t>
 <t id="350319">Hurry it up he's heading into the sector.</t>
 <t id="350320">We've lost him I'll need to get more power cells for this jump drive. I'll meet you back at Farnham's Legend.</t>
 <t id="350321">I'm all powered up and ready to go when you are, JB.</t>
 <t id="350322">Just don't mess it up again this time.</t>
 <t id="350323">Let's get it right this time, hey, JB?</t>
 <t id="350328">Okay, where do I live?</t>
 <t id="350331">Yeah, I'll go home, right after I've fragged your bastu!</t>
 <t id="350333">Hey, if it gets you to shut up, I'll surrender and let you do it now.</t>
 <t id="350341">Give us the crystal.</t>
 <t id="350343">Hey, there's a lady here you know. Have you no manners?</t>
 <t id="350346">You found him? Don't let him get away!</t>
 <t id="350347">Wow you found him! You sure you need me?</t>
 <t id="350348">Why do we even need the scanner with you here?</t>
 <t id="350501">Come on, JB, we need to find that pirate station it's over to the West.</t>
 <t id="350502">The Talon won't hang around if they hear we're in the sector, we'd better find that pirate station, JB.</t>
 <t id="350503">Nice of you to join me, JB.</t>
 <t id="350701">We're too far away to get a jumplock. We'll have to get closer.</t>
 <t id="350702">Keep those fighters off me! Here's a hint, they're the red ones on your scope!</t>
 <t id="350703">Almost there.</t>
 <t id="350704">You've got to get within '3' k, JB, or I can't get a lock!</t>
 <t id="350705">The signal's weak, come on!</t>
 <t id="350706">I said 'three' kilometres. Were you this bad at kiss chase?</t>
 <t id="350707">Got a positive lock. Just keep up until he jumps</t>
 <t id="350708">Ship locked, waiting for co-ordinates.</t>
 <t id="350709">(Singing) I know where you're going!</t>
 <t id="350710">I've lost him, you've got to get closer before he jumps.</t>
 <t id="350711">I've lost him, JB.</t>
 <t id="350712">You'll have to get closer than that.</t>
 <t id="350713">Pirates give you a rash or something? Keep up with it!</t>
 <t id="350714">Come on, JB! You're flying like a rookie.</t>
 <t id="350715">I got him. Uploading the coordinates to your computer. Let's hurry, JB, he won't stay there forever.</t>
 <t id="350716">Got a positive lock. Sending jump coordinates. Let's get there before he jumps again!</t>
 <t id="350717">He didn't go far. Hit the jump drive, I've sent you the location.</t>
 <t id="350720">You have to keep those fighters off my back. I can't get a lock, JB.</t>
 <t id="350721">Come back, JB! I need your help!</t>
 <t id="350722">Clear those fighters, JB!</t>
 <t id="350723">What was that!?</t>
 <t id="350725">You keep an eye on it, I'll get a lock on the Talon.</t>
 <t id="350726">Where did that ship go?</t>
 <t id="350728">First the crystal, now a ship. We're going to have to get your eyes tested, JB.</t>
 <t id="350729">That was his last jump. His drive's down.</t>
 <t id="350730">His shields have gone. Targeting engines.</t>
 <t id="350731">Keep an eye out for escorts, I'll see what it is.</t>
 <t id="350732">I've got the crystal aboard, let's get it to safety. Bye, bye losers! Come on let's get out of here</t>
 <t id="350736">He's going to jump any second!</t>
 <t id="350737">Two more jumps and he's ours!</t>
 <t id="350738">Let's get close and cosy to him again!</t>
 <t id="350739">Jump co-ordinate lock in 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.</t>
 <t id="350740">Jump lock acquired!</t>
 <t id="350741">You've got to stop those fighters getting between us and him, JB!</t>
 <t id="350742">You figure we could get a forwarding address for him? Maybe he's on Pirates reunited?</t>
 <t id="350743">Oh, a pirate's life for me...</t>
 <t id="350745">He can't keep running forever, he'll run out of power cells soon. Let's go!</t>
 <t id="350746">There he is, let's get him, JB.</t>
 <t id="350748">Cos, we know where you live.</t>
 <t id="350750">Let's see if he likes this.</t>
 <t id="350751">Surprise! What can I say? We just liked your company.</t>
 <t id="350752">Fancy meeting you here!</t>
 <t id="350753">Come on, JB, I think he's tiring, not many jumps now...</t>
 <t id="350754">You can jump but you can't hide.</t>
 <t id="350759">Scanners check it out okay.</t>
 <t id="351101">Hurry up, JB, we have to get after him.</t>
 <t id="351301">And I heard you never ran out of energy, JB. Pick up some more cells and meet me in Farnham's Legend.</t>
 <t id="351401">It's best we wait here. The Don won't want to get too far from his defences.</t>
 <t id="351604">Over there! It's that ship again.</t>
 <t id="351606">Only ones I've planned.</t>
 <t id="351608">I'll get over to Terracorp HQ, see if anyone in security can identify the ship. Fly safe, JB.</t>
 <t id="352201">That's not everything, JB. You need the jump drive and at least 70 units worth of cells.</t>
 <t id="430202">Does Ban know you're pretending to be an Argon escort?</t>
 <t id="430204">Since the Kha'ak started blowing our fleets to bits. I'm here to make sure these ships get through.</t>
 <t id="430206">Ask the Paranid, they can't get enough of it.</t>
 <t id="430208">Yeah. I showed it to a lot of experts.</t>
 <t id="430210">They couldn't recognise it either. Okay, ladies and gentleman of the convoy, our Argon military escort has finally arrived. If you'd like to proceed on course.</t>
 <t id="430401">Fleet to red alert. All ships to flank speed. Close up in the middle you're leaving too much room!</t>
 <t id="430402">JB!</t>
 <t id="430440">Quick, JB, can you get to that freighter?</t>
 <t id="430441">You're going to have to take out those pursuing fighters, JB.</t>
 <t id="430442">There are too many! Take out those ships!</t>
 <t id="430443">Watch out for any more arrivals and keep them away from us.</t>
 <t id="430444">If you handle the ships that are chasing us, we'll get the others.</t>
 <t id="430445">We're taking too much damage, JB, you have to take more of them out!</t>
 <t id="430448">Cover that freighter or we've lost it.</t>
 <t id="430449">That freighter's taking too much damage!</t>
 <t id="430450">Cover that ship until they get their shields back up!</t>
 <t id="430701">There're too many of them! We're going to have to go for the!</t>
 <t id="430801">The Kha'ak don't need any help, JB!</t>
 <t id="430803">Aim straight, you baka!</t>
 <t id="430901">Thanks, JB, Terracorp owes you one.</t>
 <t id="430903">And who knows....one day you might get to collect. (To the fleet) Okay, we still need to get to Empire's Edge, so keep your eyes on those scanners.</t>
 <t id="431001">Okay, fleet, let's dock and unload.</t>
 <t id="431003">Hey, JB, you want me to pick those drones up for you?</t>
 <t id="431005">Hey, which one of us gave the Stone to the bad guy? Someone's got to keep an eye on you.</t>
 <t id="431007">Then I'll see you there.</t>
 <t id="431505">Hi, JB, any chance of you flying all the way with us? We took a beating last time.</t>
 <t id="440003">I've got your cargo. What's the plan?</t>
 <t id="440005">Original. Anyone brought any decent movies?</t>
 <t id="440008">I'll drop the first drone. You fly it, I'll keep an eye out for trouble.</t>
 <t id="440501">Careful!</t>
 <t id="440502">Watch out for that scanner here!</t>
 <t id="440503">Careful, there's a drone approaching!</t>
 <t id="440504">Nice move.</t>
 <t id="440505">Be gentle with it, JB.</t>
 <t id="440507">If I ever decide to flirt with you, you'll know about it.</t>
 <t id="440508">There's more of them.</t>
 <t id="440509">I think you're through.</t>
 <t id="440513">You don't have to whisper, Noah, he can't hear you.</t>
 <t id="440514">Keep following the passage it can't be much further.</t>
 <t id="440515">The Yaki have put some defences up, you'll have to get through without triggering them, or they'll know we're here.</t>
 <t id="440519">There's a scanner there. Keep out of its range and you'll be all right.</t>
 <t id="440520">You've triggered the automatic defences!</t>
 <t id="440521">What's that?</t>
 <t id="440523">They must have mobile defences, this is going to get tricky.</t>
 <t id="440524">The drone's taking too much damage.</t>
 <t id="440525">Fly closer to the wall.</t>
 <t id="440526">Go over it.</t>
 <t id="440529">You gotta dodge that scanner.</t>
 <t id="440530">You're almost in its beam.</t>
 <t id="440531">You're going to trigger it.</t>
 <t id="440532">It'll pick you up, move away!</t>
 <t id="440533">Another couple of shots and the drone's had it!</t>
 <t id="440534">Good job we've got another drone, this one's almost gone!</t>
 <t id="440535">Slow down</t>
 <t id="440536">Watch out for the scanners this time.</t>
 <t id="440537">It's firing!</t>
 <t id="440538">You'll have to hide!</t>
 <t id="440539">Try hiding.</t>
 <t id="440540">Take it slowly.</t>
 <t id="440543">Let's not take any chances here, JB, we were lucky they didn't detect it on its way in. Stay in the tunnel.</t>
 <t id="440544">Stay in, JB!</t>
 <t id="440545">How much ear wax've you got? I said don't fly out! Engaging the self-destruct mechanism.</t>
 <t id="440550">There's a turret coming up.</t>
 <t id="440551">There's another scanner.</t>
 <t id="440552">Watch out for that rock!</t>
 <t id="440553">Take out the power conduit.</t>
 <t id="440554">You have to find the power nodes to take out the turrets.</t>
 <t id="440555">Take out the power conduit.</t>
 <t id="440556">That's the wrong target, hit the power node.</t>
 <t id="440557">Come on JB, it's not even moving.</t>
 <t id="440558">No wonder you got caught stealing that spaceship.</t>
 <t id="440559">Brute force won't do it, you have to get sneaky!</t>
 <t id="440601">I'm launching another drone, but be careful. We can't afford to let them to detect us.</t>
 <t id="440602">Don't you play video games, JB? This is the last drone, so don't crash it!</t>
 <t id="440603">Launching another drone.</t>
 <t id="440604">And they let you fly spaceships? I'm not being your passenger again!!</t>
 <t id="440701">They've detected us. They're launching ships!</t>
 <t id="440703">Let's get out of here!</t>
 <t id="440802">At least someone brought a movie.</t>
 <t id="440807">Noah...?</t>
 <t id="440814">Heads up boys, our friend's back.</t>
 <t id="440815">I think we've outstayed our welcome.</t>
 <t id="440817">Let's go!!!</t>
 <t id="440901">Go for the gate!</t>
 <t id="441001">Come on, JB. They hit you with those disruptors, you'll be a sitting target.</t>
 <t id="441003">(Arriving in Cloudbase South West/next sector) Everyone okay? Noah?</t>
 <t id="441102">We can't do anything about Ion until we find a way to stop those missiles. Julian? Are you okay?</t>
 <t id="441104">We will find a way to put this right, JB.</t>
 <t id="441106">I'll push for firm information on that ship, we've had enough surprises. I'll contact you when we have anything.</t>
 <t id="460301">What's up JB?</t>
 <t id="460303">Oooh swapsies. Where is she?</t>
 <t id="460305">Okay, you dock at the station and see what you can find, I'll ask around see if anyone else in the system knows anything. First place I'd check, JB, is the BB.</t>
 <t id="460401">Hey, lazy, get on that trading station and get looking.</t>
 <t id="460402">You're going to have to boost your reputation if you want to dock.</t>
 <t id="460403">You would have to fall out with them. Better boost your relations with them, then you can dock.</t>
 <t id="460701">What you got, JB?</t>
 <t id="460704">Lucky you brought me then. I've been playing detective and everyone's pointing us to the silicon mine.</t>
 <t id="460908">Pleasure complex? You mean slaves!</t>
 <t id="460910">I got offered a lot of credits by a Teladi to work in one of those places. He still can't walk straight. It's no place for a little girl, we need to find her and fast.</t>
 <t id="460912">Then what do you suggest?</t>
 <t id="460914">Like what? Hey! You'd better not be suggesting what I think you're suggesting!</t>
 <t id="460916">Come on let's get to Teladi Gain. And JB you tell anyone about this and you won't be walking straight. Engaging jump drive.</t>
 <t id="461001">How do you think a Goner priest got involved with the Yaki? I haven't met one that would hurt a spacefly let alone mastermind a smash and grab raid!</t>
 <t id="461003">I don't know. Not getting shot at on such a regular basis would be a good start. Can't really think of anything else.</t>
 <t id="461005">Where are your roots?</t>
 <t id="461007">You know anytime you want to stop bombing around the universe shooting things we'll find a place for you at Terracorp.</t>
 <t id="461009">No, but if you're going to get shot at you might at least get holiday pay.</t>
 <t id="461011">Er, what about me getting scared?</t>
 <t id="461013">We ever do this again, you're getting waxed and putting on a dress.</t>
 <t id="461014">Okay, JB, don't get closer than five kilometres, or you might scare the pirates off. Once they've got me, you'll have to tail them.</t>
 <t id="461101">They've taken the bait. The ship's immobilised. You'd better stay close, but don't ...they're coming onboard!</t>
 <t id="461201">You're getting too close, JB. Back off before they see you.</t>
 <t id="461202">You're still too close!</t>
 <t id="461203">Keep your distance, JB, I don't want to be in this get up much longer. This top's making me itch.</t>
 <t id="461204">Nice to know you care, but care from further away.</t>
 <t id="461302">Hey, you forget me, JB?</t>
 <t id="461501">(Angry, whispering) Hey, remember I'm onboard!</t>
 <t id="461601">(Whispering) Okay, we're docking (some clanging and docking noise run under this). Can you get close and cause some sort of distraction so I can get away? Try taking out those mines. Someone's coming I'd better...(signal goes dead)</t>
 <t id="461701">(In the background we hear alarms) I've got away. Stay close but stay undetected, we still have to get out of here.</t>
 <t id="461901">(Whispering) Come on, JB, there's no way I'll be able to get away on my own. Shoot those squash mines!</t>
 <t id="461902">(Whispering) Where've you been, JB? Get me out of here!</t>
 <t id="462202">JB, I've found Miria, but the Yaki have got some sort of transporter dampener. You'll have to get inside to get us out.</t>
 <t id="462204">That's one idea. We'll meet you at the docking area. And hurry up! For some reason the station's leaking air.</t>
 <t id="462211">(Audio only) No can do. The release doors've jammed on the escape pods, we're all trapped. You'll have to get to the doors.</t>
 <t id="462213">Then hurry up! You can get to the pods through an access in the docking area. It'll have a force field over it, take the generator out to get in. Oh, and JB, be careful with my ship!!</t>
 <t id="462216">You'll have to blast the door off each pod.</t>
 <t id="462217">(audio only) That's everyone! Get yourself out of there!</t>
 <t id="462218">You took your time!</t>
 <t id="462220">Can you ask stupid questions? It's my ship, dimwad!</t>
 <t id="462227">Just me and Miria now.</t>
 <t id="462230">Come on, JB! I asked for a rescue, not a taxi pick up!</t>
 <t id="462231">We're losing air here, JB!</t>
 <t id="462232">Er, you want the good news, or the bad news?</t>
 <t id="462234">You're not dead yet.</t>
 <t id="462236">The reactor's leaking. Any minute now it'll blow and we'll be radioactive cinders.</t>
 <t id="462238">Yeah, we just thought we'd stay to keep you company. Get your bastu in here, JB!!</t>
 <t id="462242">You stopped for a leak?</t>
 <t id="462244">JB, we're going to die if you don't pick it up!</t>
 <t id="462245">Another [three] to go.</t>
 <t id="462246">Two more, JB.</t>
 <t id="462247">It's just us now!</t>
 <t id="462248">You want to get out of here, or not?</t>
 <t id="462249">Fly faster, shoot better!</t>
 <t id="462251">There's still another two pods.</t>
 <t id="462252">Three left. Hurry up!</t>
 <t id="462258">They've got laser grids set up. You'll have to take the generators out, or they'll turn you into diced chickadee.</t>
 <t id="462260">That explosion took out the weapon dampeners, you can fire in here.</t>
 <t id="462261">That ship better not have a scratch on it!</t>
 <t id="462262">Are you stopping to look at the sights, or what? Get us out of here!</t>
 <t id="462263">The Pods are grouped together look for a set of hatches.</t>
 <t id="462264">You're breaking up, JB, you must be moving away from us.</t>
 <t id="462265">Signal's clearer, you're getting closer.</t>
 <t id="462268">That's it, JB, first pod away, keep it up!</t>
 <t id="462269">That's another pod keep going!</t>
 <t id="462270">That's the first set, look for the others.</t>
 <t id="462271">The pods aren't all together, so keep your eyes open.</t>
 <t id="462301">I think I know where Miria is, but there are a lot of guards. I'll need you to get me out of here as soon as I find her.</t>
 <t id="462501">You'll need to get to the docking area to transport us. They've got shielding in here.</t>
 <t id="462903">That's everyone, thanks, JB. I'm sure all the ladies here will be pleased to hear you can shoot straight. Let's get back to the Don.</t>
 <t id="462904">Yeah, I'm fine, thanks for asking and yes, I've got the Don's little girl here.</t>
 <t id="462906">Well, as long this 'little' girl was supposed to be 22 then she's fine.</t>
 <t id="463001">Hey, remember I'm on board.</t>
 <t id="463002">Stop firing at the station you idiot!</t>
 <t id="463602">Not quite. You want to explain, JB?</t>
 <t id="463604">Yeah, suspicious how well he knew the inside of a pleasure complex.</t>
 <t id="463606">I thought that was your regular 'Saturday' night.</t>
 <t id="463608">Er, no offence, I think these girls have gone through enough without us handing them over to another pirate.</t>
 <t id="463611">Keep your eyes on the spacelanes, JB. Don't want you getting distracted and hitting any asteroids, do we? Now hit that jump drive and meet me in Farnham's Legend.</t>
 <t id="463612">You gone spacebrain? Where've you been?</t>
 <t id="463613">Keep your eyes on the spacelanes, JB. Don't want you getting distracted and hitting any asteroids, do we?</t>
 <t id="463806">You go after them, I'll take this data to Noah, see what he makes of it.</t>
 <t id="463810">Oh, yeah, nothing to worry about there.</t>
 <t id="550203">So, we plan a little ambush?</t>
 <t id="550208">Glad you could join us. Miria not with you?</t>
 <t id="550210">Glad you missed me. We're heading for the West Gate in Ore Belt, so fire up those thrusters.</t>
 <t id="550214">And they say real men don't fire blanks.</t>
 <t id="550217">I'll contact Ban and organise the ships we need. Meet us back here in about an hour, okay, JB?</t>
 <t id="550311">You're going to have to help the security ship, JB!</t>
 <t id="550316">We're taking heavy casualties.</t>
 <t id="550317">They're running, get after them.</t>
 <t id="550318">Don't let them get away.</t>
 <t id="550319">Stop those fighters, JB!</t>
 <t id="550401">Where's Ion?</t>
 <t id="550403">We'll have to take his shields down.</t>
 <t id="550507">You recruit pirates, you're going to get treated like one.</t>
 <t id="550801">It's that ship again.</t>
 <t id="551007">Kyle's not the only one that's been there. I showed my mother the pictures from our spydrone. It's not Earth.</t>
 <t id="610101">I don't trust Ion as far as I could throw him in heavy gravity.</t>
 <t id="610103">Any ideas how we build a mine in closed space? I could talk to my Terracorp contacts, but the Paranid aren't even letting our convoys in.</t>
 <t id="610105">Your contacts? You suddenly got a social life?</t>
 <t id="610301">How do you know this guy?</t>
 <t id="610303">And we can trust him? She's a pirate, JB.</t>
 <t id="610310">You actually managed to out-arrogance a Paranid. You know how hard that is?</t>
 <t id="610312">A lot. So, I'm going to take a well earned break and wait here while you raise the credits.</t>
 <t id="610314">(Teasing) Really? I thought it was Miria that did that.</t>
 <t id="610503">There's trading, or if you're pushed there are jobs on the Bulletin Boards on stations, otherwise you could saddle up and try some racing. Noah says you're pretty good at it.</t>
 <t id="610505">Well, I suppose if you're desperate...</t>
 <t id="610702">Congratulations, Julian, a promotion!</t>
 <t id="610706">Well, that went smoothly enough. Time for you to go and visit the Paranid...Julie.</t>
 <t id="611801">Let's get that Seed thing back to Noah. I don't like having it around. It's got me worried.</t>
 <t id="612105">How many times have you heard that line?</t>
 <t id="612108">Don't know what you mean. I'm just going to relax a little.</t>
 <t id="614412">We'd better get back to Noah, see what we have to do with it. Reproductive Organs?</t>
 <t id="614420">You got it! What do we do with that thing now?</t>
 <t id="614422">Yeah, only a Kha'ak invasion to worry about now. It feels almost quiet.</t>
 <t id="614424">I didn't mean it! I didn't mean it! Do you think this Seed really makes a jump event? I mean if it does...</t>
 <t id="614426">No! One mysterious alien invasion a jazura's enough. I have a note from my doctor and everything.</t>
 <t id="710101">You'd better go, JB. I'll get this Seed thing back to Ban.</t>
 <t id="710103">Looks like you're finally going to get to meet him.</t>
 <t id="710105">Just be yourself, JB. (Trying to lift him) On second thoughts, try and be someone else, he might like you better.</t>
 <t id="710107">Be careful. Okay? You know what some of these flightjockeys can be like, he even tries to defend himself and he'll be seen as a defector. That goes for you too. Keep that trigger finger still, JB and good luck.</t>
 <t id="720202">Until now.</t>
 <t id="720205">Terracorp alone has shipped fifteen convoys to them.</t>
 <t id="720212">I've put some information together on Terracorp shipments and I think we should start with the installation in Emperor Mines.</t>
 <t id="720235">Transporting you over.</t>
 <t id="720301">And what am I supposed to do back here while you're flying round?</t>
 <t id="720302">Let's get to Emperor Mines, JB</t>
 <t id="720304">Are we nearly there yet?</t>
 <t id="720305">I just put my hand in something gunky down here. Don't know what it is. I don't want to know what it is. You ever thought about, you know, maybe cleaning this ship, JB? No wonder you're single.</t>
 <t id="720306">This poster by the lockers...is it physically possible to do that without dislocating something?</t>
 <t id="720308">Yeah, yeah. I believe you.</t>
 <t id="720309">Hey, JB. You know that poster? There are some more down here.</t>
 <t id="720311">This girl looks like Miria. And this one...there's no way they're real.</t>
 <t id="720313">And how would you know how to do that?</t>
 <t id="720315">You want Mi Ton to operate your equipment?</t>
 <t id="720701">What are you doing, JB? You need the equipment we have onboard. And, hey, you need me!</t>
 <t id="720702">Oh, right, realise you forgot something did you?</t>
 <t id="720801">Okay, JB, the installation's over to the East.</t>
 <t id="720802">Okay, JB, the installation is over to the west.</t>
 <t id="720803">Okay, JB, the installation is over to the North.</t>
 <t id="720804">Okay, JB, the installation is over to the South.</t>
 <t id="720904">Come back onboard, JB.</t>
 <t id="721001">We'll need to get close up in case of shielding. We scan their storage and processing areas then we'll know how much Nividium's here.</t>
 <t id="721002">It's empty, only small traces of Nividium. They must've shipped it out. Or they've got through a lot quickly.</t>
 <t id="721004">The next installation is in Paranid Prime. Let's see if that gives us any clues.</t>
 <t id="721005">I've marked the sections you need to scan. You'll have to get me within twenty five metres to scan through the shielding.</t>
 <t id="721006">All these technical bits, Ban's gadget mad isn't he?</t>
 <t id="721007">I've marked up the sections you need to scan, so just join the dots. Get me to within twenty five metres and we'll let this technical thingy do it's magic.</t>
 <t id="721008">I've marked the sections you need to scan. You'll have to get me within 50 metres to scan through the shielding.</t>
 <t id="721009">I've marked the sections you need to scan. You'll have to get me within 100 metres to scan through the shielding.</t>
 <t id="721010">I've marked up the sections you need to scan, so just join the dots. Get me to within 50 metres and we'll let this technical thingy do it's magic.</t>
 <t id="721011">I've marked up the sections you need to scan, so just join the dots. Get me to within 100 metres and we'll let this technical thingy do it's magic.</t>
 <t id="721102">Scanning...negative, no Nividium there.</t>
 <t id="721104">Scanning...no, only tiny trace elements.</t>
 <t id="721202">We need to go to Paranid Prime.</t>
 <t id="721203">We need to go to Empire's Edge.</t>
 <t id="721204">We need to go to Duke's Domain.</t>
 <t id="721301">You'll need to take us out to The North. They don't put these stations close to anything else. You figure they might be doing something dangerous with the Nividium?</t>
 <t id="721303">You'll need to take us out to The East. They don't put these stations close to anything else. You figure they might be doing something dangerous with the Nividium?</t>
 <t id="721304">You'll need to take us out to The South. They don't put these stations close to anything else. You figure they might be doing something dangerous with the Nividium?</t>
 <t id="721305">You'll need to take us out to The West. They don't put these stations close to anything else. You figure they might be doing something dangerous with the Nividium?</t>
 <t id="721401">That's it. I'm running scan...</t>
 <t id="721402">One down.</t>
 <t id="721403">Keep going.</t>
 <t id="721404">Just one left now.</t>
 <t id="721405">Half way there, JB, neat flying.</t>
 <t id="721406">I've got 50% scanned.</t>
 <t id="721407">80% of wreckage scanned. Nearly there.</t>
 <t id="721408">That's it, we've got enough.</t>
 <t id="721409">That should be enough data.</t>
 <t id="721410">Get in closer.</t>
 <t id="721411">Hurry it up, JB.</t>
 <t id="721412">Faster, faster!</t>
 <t id="721413">Come on, show me your moves.</t>
 <t id="721414">Two left.</t>
 <t id="721415">Two down.</t>
 <t id="721416">That's another.</t>
 <t id="721417">Got that one.</t>
 <t id="721418">Yeah, got it.</t>
 <t id="721419">Look for the next one.</t>
 <t id="721420">On to the next one.</t>
 <t id="721501">I'm just picking up the station, no Nividium. There is debris that could be from Kha'ak ships though.</t>
 <t id="721503">I list five Terracorp convoys coming to this place alone. I logged two of them and they were loaded with Nividium. Where's it gone?</t>
 <t id="721508">Issued for what?</t>
 <t id="721510">Punch the button, JB. Let's get to Empire's Edge.</t>
 <t id="721601">This is supposed to be a secret mission, let's get out and get on before we raise any more suspicion.</t>
 <t id="721701">Okay, we're heading out to</t>
 <t id="721801">Take us in, I'll see what I can pick up.</t>
 <t id="721901">That's it and I've got nothing.</t>
 <t id="721903">Could be...</t>
 <t id="721904">Just one more sector to go, JB, let's ditch this patrol and take a look.</t>
 <t id="721908">We didn't kill Armanckessilon!</t>
 <t id="721913">What's happening, JB?!</t>
 <t id="721916">What's going on, JB?!</t>
 <t id="721918">We've got one on our tail!</t>
 <t id="721919">Let's get out of here, JB, we're not here to fight them!</t>
 <t id="721921">They might be wrong, but they're definitely trying to kill us.</t>
 <t id="721922">Baka ne paranids!</t>
 <t id="721924">Come on, JB, let's go!</t>
 <t id="722001">Let's make this quick and dodge your fan club. The installation is over to the</t>
 <t id="722102">Hey, it was here, one of the biggest installations I've ever seen. It's where most of the Nividium came to. (scanning) No debris. Look, there's no way they could've towed it out of here.</t>
 <t id="722105">There's a ship coming up on us. Looks like a transport</t>
 <t id="722108">I told you! And I got the readings - massive amounts of Nividium. (Excited) I heard rumours the Paranid had a cloaking device, but everyone said it didn't work.</t>
 <t id="722112">I've got Paranid ships coming in through the gate. It's Armanckessilon's family, and they've brought friends. (An even bigger fleet than last time appears). Let's get back to Argon One. We have to tell Ban about this.</t>
 <t id="722116">I know you're not one to run away from a fight, but let's just get out of here!</t>
 <t id="722201">All those ships are going to do is draw attention, JB. This is supposed to be a secret mission, yeah?</t>
 <t id="722302">We've still got another two installations. Let's start at Paranid Prime.</t>
 <t id="722303">We've still got another three installations. Let's start at Empire's Edge.</t>
 <t id="722304">We've still got one installation left to check. Let's head for Duke's Domain.</t>
 <t id="722401">Stop playing with these guys and get out here. It's the intelligence material that matters.</t>
 <t id="722503">Argon One? Big Ship? Lots of Guns? In Argon Prime? You must remember it. So, try flying there.</t>
 <t id="722504">You ever hear the one about the spacebrain that flew off carrying Argon Secret Service Equipment? No! Because they're treading water in a Split swamp somewhere. Come on, JB let's get this stuff back to BD.</t>
 <t id="722601">We need to be in Emperor Mines, JB, where are you going?</t>
 <t id="722602">This isn't Empire's Edge. You're in the wrong place.</t>
 <t id="722603">I was thinking Paranid Prime not here, as, well...Paranid Prime's where the installation is!</t>
 <t id="722604">The installation's in Duke's Domain. So, what are we doing here?</t>
 <t id="722605">Let's go to Empire's Edge, JB!</t>
 <t id="722606">Let's go to Duke's Domain, JB!</t>
 <t id="722607">Let's go to Paranid Prime, JB!</t>
 <t id="722608">Let's go to Emperor Mines, JB!</t>
 <t id="723402">I've had a look at this equipment. They must be stretched at Argon command, it's ancient. We're gonna have to get close to whatever we scan to get any readings.</t>
 <t id="730002">What do you think's going on, JB?</t>
 <t id="800108">Hey, JB! Need some help?</t>
 <t id="800113">Nice war you've found.</t>
 <t id="800120">You find Earth just in time for it to be destroyed. Not the best timing!</t>
 <t id="800122">Where are they all coming from?</t>
 <t id="800143">Three to go!</t>
 <t id="800144">There's still two left, don't let them get through.</t>
 <t id="800145">It's the last one, JB, finish it off!</t>
 <t id="800147">You did it! I have a ship heading your way to pick you up.</t>
 <t id="800148">One more hit and that ship will blow! You have to intercept those fighters!!</t>
 <t id="800149">Shimatta, another hit. They are going to blow!!</t>
 <t id="800151">That was close!</t>
 <t id="800164">Is that it? Or has it gone quiet for a reason?</t>
 <t id="800167">This is not looking good.</t>
 <t id="800168">Did you find out what the Paranid were doing?</t>
 <t id="800304">Forget the station, we've got ships coming from all sides.</t>
 <t id="800306">Good point.</t>
 <t id="800308">Just get after him!</t>
 <t id="800403">We can't!</t>
 <t id="800406">The Kha'ak don't use the gates. Is it Sargon?</t>
 <t id="800410">What about Julian?</t>
 <t id="800414">But surely after what has...</t>
 <t id="800430">More jump points opening</t>
 <t id="800432">What about Earth?</t>
 <t id="800433">They're running!</t>
 <t id="800437">Shame Julian's not here to see this, he's good at last stands.</t>
 <t id="900231">Well, if Julian can shoot things that fire back, they're space dust.</t>
 <t id="900232">Think of the thirty ladies you've just rescued who are going to be very grateful.</t>
 <t id="900233">And Noah was telling me what a hot race pilot you are.</t>

 <t id="320002">Brennansama, please could you meet me at the Goner Temple. I know I have asked much of you in the past, but I have another favour to ask you. I hope to see you shortly.</t>
 <t id="320101">Greetings, Brennansama, thank you for coming. I was most grieved to hear of your father's condition.</t>
 <t id="320104">(Embarrassed) Well, er...</t>
 <t id="320109">We have a valuable cargo that needs transporting, but with all the pirate activity we need someone to operate the transport ship's defences and as we, er, well...</t>
 <t id="410001">(Relieved) Brennansama, I am most happy you are well. We heard what happened and have been trying to discover who took the Stone.</t>
 <t id="410005">Brennansama, it was Ion who stole the Stone! The Don has the second stone Ion needs.</t>
 <t id="410007">We are not sure of their purpose, only that they hold great power. There is a priest, Thomus, he will help us find Ion, if we can find him. Will you come with me?</t>
 <t id="410009">Thomus is normally in Freedom's Reach. I will send the details to you.</t>
 <t id="410301">Thomus's friend is a Teladi trader on the trading station. We should dock there.</t>
 <t id="410302">Oh good, you have docked. Please wait, I will be with you shortly.</t>
 <t id="410303">Oh dear, it appears you need to have a higher, erm, level of notoriety for them to accept you here. I will wait until they will let you dock.</t>
 <t id="410304">It appears you've upset them in some way. Find a way to make amends, or they will not allow you to dock here.</t>
 <t id="410501">Lihimes Eluleis Gebnduis III, Thomus's friend. (we hear Noah activate the comm.) I do hope Thomus is alright.</t>
 <t id="410503">No, friend, we seek help. We are looking for Thomus Beckitt.</t>
 <t id="410505">We can pay. Name your price.</t>
 <t id="410507">A pilot you say?</t>

 <t id="420103">Thomus?</t>
 <t id="420105">It's Ion. He's stolen the White Stone.</t>
 <t id="420107">And you were right, Thomus.</t>
 <t id="420201">Can we get to Ban Danna as quickly as possible please, Brennansama? I'm worried about Thomus.</t>
 <t id="430007">We would be most grateful.</t>
 <t id="431002">Brennansama, we too must hurry, time is pressing.</t>
 <t id="431006">Ion has arranged to meet Thomus in Ocracoke's Storm.</t>
 <t id="431101">We should get to Ocracoke's Storm quickly, Brennansama.</t>
 <t id="440001">Oh dear, there are a lot of them.</t>
 <t id="440007">I have a lock on his homing beacon.</t>
 <t id="440101">You should tell the other ships to go, Brennansama. We don't want to risk the pirates seeing us.</t>
 <t id="440201">They appear to have seen us.</t>
 <t id="440301">Be careful, Brennansama. We can't let them detect us. I don't want Ion to get away.</t>
 <t id="440302">We need to stay undercover, Brennansama. We have to discover what Ion is doing.</t>
 <t id="440401">Oh, no!</t>
 <t id="440510">Be careful, Brennansama.</t>
 <t id="440511">I hope Thomus is all right.</t>
 <t id="440512">(whispering) There that's Ion.</t>
 <t id="440804">No. There has to be more.</t>
 <t id="440805">Oh my, oh my. He can't have.</t>
 <t id="440813">He can't have. After all these years...</t>
 <t id="440816">We must get this information to Argon command immediately. My goodness. Earth.</t>
 <t id="440902">Please, we must return to Argon now.</t>
 <t id="441101">How can he have found it? What does he mean by a gate?</t>
 <t id="441105">Yes, indeed. I will meet Thomus and find out more.</t>
 <t id="441107">Thank you for your help, Brennansama. I will be in touch soon.</t>
 <t id="550001">Welcome, Brennansama. You have the other crystals? This is wonderful. Wonderful. Now we stand a chance of stopping Ion. Please meet me at the Goner Temple. Thomus and Saya are here.</t>
 <t id="550201">Well done, Brennansama. If only we knew how Ion was to use these crystals.</t>
 <t id="550205">There have been too many lives lost already, Brennansama.</t>
 <t id="550219">Yes, yes, thank you, Thomus.</t>
 <t id="551001">I am relieved to see you, Brennansama.</t>
 <t id="551003">Ion.</t>

 <t id="730906">Now who's recruiting pirates?</t>
 <t id="740005">Was the seed crystal there?</t>
 <t id="740013">There are things bigger than all of us. One life for a greater cause.</t>
 <t id="740015">It's an energy vortex the ancients created. You can't let it get damaged, if it's unleashed without programming, or containing gates ... the consequences will be terrible.</t>
 <t id="740402">The energy vortex is forming!</t>
 <t id="750202">Brennansama, it is an honour to see you again.</t>
 <t id="750204">If Dogun had known, he would've been happy to lay down his life for Earth.</t>
 <t id="750207">No.</t>
 <t id="760108">They're playing with things they don't understand.</t>
 <t id="760111">Quickly, the event will tear itself apart, it will destroy everything for sectors unless there is a gate to hold it in place.</t>
 <t id="760116">You must get me inside, to the transmitter controls.</t>
 <t id="760127">It must bind the event here. If you place it near the event it should be automatic.</t>
 <t id="760133">You won't make it in that ship, not until the other end is capped.</t>
 <t id="760135">We must defend the gate. If the Kha'ak get through to Earth...</t>
 <t id="760142">Hurry, we have little time.</t>
 <t id="760143">You must hurry, the event is going to implode.</t>
 <t id="760144">You must protect the station!</t>
 <t id="760145">The array's been damaged, it won't take much more!</t>
 <t id="760146">If we lose this station all is lost!</t>
 <t id="760147">I've done it! Sending beam now!(NB We now see the wormhole stabilise and hold.) It's stabilising. Quickly now we must get the gates in position!</t>
 <t id="760151">Sargon told me a little of how it works. I think I can stabilise it.</t>
 <t id="760155">In there, quickly!</t>
 <t id="760156">Couldn't they see how fragile the crystal was?</t>
 <t id="760160">Quickly.</t>
 <t id="760162">We're running out of time.</t>
 <t id="760163">We're almost there! Faster!</t>
 <t id="760164">I hope they haven't changed the controls, we must stop this.</t>
 <t id="760171">The station will only take a few more hits.</t>
 <t id="760172">I'm losing contact with the event, you HAVE to cover me.</t>
 <t id="760174">As you can see from the information I'm sending each wormhole needs an energy spine. Without this it will collapse.</t>
 <t id="760176">No energy spine, big wormhole go boom boom! It snaps shut and sends out shockwaves that shakes matter apart for sectors. We have to send out an energy spine from that platform then put gates in position. Understand?</t>
 <t id="760178">Well done, you just passed science. Now, you must get onboard that.</t>
 <t id="800028">The event is now stable. I only hope Kyle got through to Earth. And that it is Earth.</t>
 <t id="800114">If the Kha'ak win they'll destroy Earth!</t>
 <t id="800301">Ion ...calling all ships. The station's being moved off course. I need assistance.</t>
 <t id="800311">It's Sargon. He's trying to change the beam, you must stop him.</t>
 <t id="800313">Sargon's trying to reprogram the beam. You'll have to destroy this station.</t>
 <t id="800315">There's no time, you have to destroy it.</t>
 <t id="800316">You must destroy the station's reactor. It's the only way.</t>
 <t id="800319">Hurry, I'm losing the lock on Earth!</t>
 <t id="800320">He's almost broken the signal.</t>
 <t id="800321">Another few seconds and we'll lose Earth.</t>
 <t id="800322">I'm doing what I can, but you must hurry.</t>
 <t id="800324">You must take out the four power nodes - that will overload the reactor.</t>
 <t id="800325">You've done it. Power dropping. Get out before it blows.</t>
 <t id="800327">Just go.</t>
 <t id="800328">For Earth.</t>
 <t id="800340">He's changed the wormhole. We've lost Earth.</t>
 <t id="800342">The station's coming apart, it's going to break up...</t>
 <t id="908003">That's impossible!</t>
 <t id="908124">Look out!</t>

 <t id="908201">How can I be of service, Brennansama?</t>
 <t id="908202">I'm disappointed in you, I thought you would understand.</t>
 <t id="908205">I'm afraid I don't know, Brennansama.</t>
 <t id="908206">You are not enlightened enough to understand.</t>
 <t id="908209">You are there, Brennansama.</t>
 <t id="908215">Be careful, Brennansama.</t>

 <t id="908219">My life is in your hands.</t>
 <t id="908220">Those that look with closed eyes cannot see. Leave me.</t>
 <t id="908221">I'm sorry, Brennansama, I can't help you.</t>
 <t id="908406">Who else could I go to?. When the wise fail to find the truth, sometimes you must seek a fool.</t>
 <t id="908407">I know very little. He showed me the plans of the projector and I saw that I could find Earth. He said he wanted the truth to be known, that the ancients had made a mistake in shutting the races off. That the Earth had been lost by accident and fate must now return it to its proper place.</t>
 <t id="908408">I have told you what I know. It is an energy vortex from which the jump events are created. This must be the last of them in our space.</t>

 <t id="911350401">Come on, JB, we can't miss this lead. The Talon is docked at a station in Farnham's Legend. I'll meet you there.</t>
 <t id="911350732">I've got the crystal onboard. Meet me at the %s Gate in sector %s.</t>
 <t id="911351201">I've lost the lock on the Talon. I need you to cover me, JB. I'll have to get more energy cells first, then I'll meet you back in Farnham's legend.</t>

 <t id="911351501">I'm still waiting, but my bet is the Don'll return to Farnham's Legend to finish those repairs. Get yourself back as soon as you can.</t>
 <t id="911351801">JB, have you been to the Goner Temple? You should warn Noah about that ship as quickly as possible.</t>
 <t id="911352001">You're going to need an M4 ship or better to have space for the jump drive. When you get one, pick up at least 70 units worth of power cells as well then meet me at the trading station.</t>
 <t id="911352101">I'm still waiting for you at the Trading station in The Hole. Pick up that ship and equipment fast and we'll get after the Don.</t>

 <t id="916350101">The police say that a pirate called Don Tony Marani took the stone. His ship - the Talon - is docked in Farnham's Legend for repairs. It has a jump drive but we have given Saya Khosama a jump scanner, so if he refuses to surrender the crystal you can follow him. When you have the crystal I will meet you. May peace find and comfort you.</t>

 <t id="400035">Ion thinks he can build a gate that leads to Earth, I doubt it, something's not right here. Looks like I've got some free time on my hands. Saya is going to try to find out more about the mysterious ship that keeps appearing, or rather disappearing, and she said she'll contact me when she's found anything out.</t>
 <t id="400040">Don Tony Marani attacked me, babbling some crazy stuff and calling me a Yaki. It seems like I've been able to get away from him but I should be wary, he might attack again.</t>
 <t id="400050">I rescued Miria Marani and some other girls from the Pleasure Complex in Teladi Gain. Saya is bringing Miria and the ladies to Don Marani's station in Farnham's Legend. I should go follow them and then talk to the Don.</t>
 <t id="119430102">You can join the fleet by the Terracorp Nividium plant in Home of Light. The fleet is made of mixed ships so be careful, they could spread out due to their different speeds - particularly if you hit trouble. Pass on my regards to the fleet captain when you reach them.</t>

 <t id="815460002">The last I heard from my daughter, she was on the trading station in Thuruk's Pride. You try there first. You find her, I help you, yeah?</t>
 <t id="815460201">You better find my daughter fast, you lousy rat. Or you'll wake up kissing the fishes, you hear me.</t>
 <t id="815464001">Have you found Miria yet? You find her, I be in your debt. You hurt her, I use your ugly skull as an ashtray.</t>
 <t id="816463901">I meet you soon. I comm. when ready.</t>
 <t id="911351801">JB, have you been to the Goner Temple? You should warn Noah about that ship as quickly as possible.</t>
 <t id="911431401">Thanks for your help, JB. Ban Danna's asked me to collect your spydrones. I'll pick them up and meet you in Ocracoke's storm.</t>
 <t id="911460101">JB, still nothing on the ship. Argon security thinks it could be from a race called the Sohnen. They were around when the old ones built the gates. No one knows much about them, but it's a lead and it does tie in with those crystals being from the ancients. Still, as it doesn't appear in the junior book of starship spotting it could be anything. I'll pick up your co-ordinates and come out to you, see if we can find out why this ship keeps turning up.</t>
 <t id="911460501">I've got nothing so far. You'd better check at the Thuruk's Pride trading station.</t>
 <t id="911460801">I've got a lead, JB. Miria went to the Silicon Mine. The base manager there works for the Don. Maybe they can tell us what happened to her. Meet me there.</t>
 <t id="911461301">Where are you, JB? I think I'm being followed and I need you here to back me up. Get your thrusters back to Teladi Gain and cover me.</t>
 <t id="911462001">Where are you, JB? I need that distraction. You're going to have to get rid of those squash mines!</t>
 <t id="911462401">I think I know where Miria is, but there are a lot of guards. I'll need you to get me out of here as soon as I find her.</t>
 <t id="911463101">I'm not hanging about here on my own. I'll be on the Trading Station in Teladi Gain. Let me know when you can spare the time to join me.</t>
 <t id="911463201">Come on, JB, the only lead we've got is the Don's daughter. Meet me on the Trading Station in Teladi Gain and let's find out what's going on.</t>

 <t id="912410102">Thomus is, well, he is rather a recluse. However, there is a friend of Thomus's on the Trading Station in Freedom's Reach, we'll have to talk to him to find out where Thomus is.</t>
 <t id="912410201">Brennansama, I am at the trading station in sector Freedom's Reach. Meet me as soon as you can.</t>
 <t id="912410401">I have docked at the Trading station, please join me there.</t>
 <t id="912410801">Brennansama, I am waiting with Geb at the Freedom's Reach Trading Station. Please come soon, we need to find Thomus quickly if we are to catch Ion.</t>

 <t id="500002">Everything is being prepared. I will come back later when the fleet is ready.</t>
 <t id="510001">I have to get in touch with Armanckessilon. He is in Paranid Prime, which is closed to every non-Paranid at the moment. But still I'll have to try to get there.</t>
 <t id="510002">I will go to Emperor Mines where I will contact Nolman on the trading station.</t>
 <t id="510003">Nolman will contact me with further information.</t>
 <t id="510004">Armanckessilon will meet me in Elena's Fortune.</t>
 <t id="510005">I need to raise the money for Nolman.</t>
 <t id="510006">I still haven't got enough money for Nolman.</t>
 <t id="520001">The black crystal should be near the shipwreck in the Xenon Sector 101. I need to get it.</t>
 <t id="530001">I've got to check out the disruptor factory in Olmancketslat's Treaty.</t>
 <t id="530002">I will meet Miria in Bala Gi's Joy. She's got a contact that can help us with the Yaki station, but I will need 10.000 credits worth of computer components.</t>
 <t id="530003">I need to scan the station in Olmancketslat's Treaty.</t>
 <t id="530004">I should contact Ban Danna. He's at the Argon One in Argon Prime.</t>
 <t id="119540001">Julian, could you meet me onboard Argon One? I've heard you might have plans of those Yaki missiles and I'd like to see them.</t>
 <t id="119540101">Julian, could you please meet me on board Argon One?</t>
 <t id="421512001">I await you in Elena's Fortune lower being. If you seek trade bring the credits quickly my patience with you is limited.</t>
 <t id="421512801">If lower life form still needs crystal, Armanckessilon will trade, but due to your stupidity, price is now %d credits.</t>
 <t id="422511702">Insignificant ones, Armanckessilon is willing to associate with your pitiful selves. He will meet you at Elena's Fortune and demands %d credits for the crystal you seek.</t>
 <t id="815500401">Okay, you want a list of the places my contacts found, you got it.</t>
 <t id="815500402">Some Paranid clown called Armanckessilon got the Blue Sculpt crystal you want, that mean you and the Yaki got big problems. This Armanckessilon's in Paranid Prime and them no-carra Paranids got their central sectors shut tighter than a Teladi's moneybag. They got heavy cruisers blasting any non-Paranids that come in. I hope they shove the Yaki's thruster pipes up their Bastu, but you, you got to find a way to contact this Paranid baka.</t>
 <t id="815500403">The other crystal they after is the Black Crystal. Catchy. Last anyone heard it was on some Xenon M0. Lucky for you it got fragged a few years ago in Nopileos' Memorial. The Xenon towed it to Xenon Sector 101. Them Yaki tried to get it, but got beat up bad. Whatever those slugtuggers want these crystals for, they want them a lot. I hope the Xenon bury them all.</t>
 <t id="815500404">That Yaki disruptor factory, they got it in Olmancketslat's Treaty. They got a lot of firepower around it, and those disruptor missiles. You want their secret, you gonna need a clever way of getting to it. You ask Miria. She's good at a clever.</t>
 <t id="815500405">And you better look after her, she break a nail, you so much as breathe on her and you'll find it hard to fly with no joystick, you know what I mean.</t>
 <t id="816500001">I am ready, so you meet me at my poppa's place in Farnham's Legend and we'll hunt Yaki.</t>
 <t id="816500101">Where are you, JB? I am at my poppa's place in Farnham's legend with the information you need and I don't like to be kept waiting!</t>
 <t id="816510901">I got a better idea, get out of there, JB, or you want to be a dead Baka?</t>
 <t id="816510902">What are you doing JB? Get out of there and go meet my contact.</t>
 <t id="816511201">Trading station, Emperor Mines. That remind you of anything? Because that's where I am and I'm getting very bored here on my own.</t>
 <t id="816511601">Have you got the credits yet? I've tried my other contacts, but Nolmancketnun is the only one willing to help. We should get back to him with the credits before he changes his mind.</t>
 <t id="816512701">Where are you JB? Armanckessilon's still in Sector Elena's Fortune and we have to get that crystal of him. You want those rectemite Yaki to get it?</t>
 <t id="816530601">Meet me on the Quantum Tube Fab in Bala Gi's Joy and hurry it up, JB.</t>
 <t id="911550320">Ion got away, but we still have the crystals. Thomus thinks Ion is desperate enough to try again. Come and meet us back at Ore Belt and let's see if we can get him this time.</t>
 <t id="911550701">JB?! Where are you? We're going to need some help if we're going to stop the Yaki stealing the crystals.</t>
 <t id="911551101">I thought you wanted to be here when we captured Ion. Meet us by the West Gate in Ore Belt as soon as possible.</t>

 <t id="600010">I should go contact Nolman on the trading station in Emperor Mines and see if he can arrange to have the mine built.</t>
 <t id="422610401">Inferior lifebeing, I have estimated the cost for building an Ore Mine at the specified location. I demand a total of %d Credits. Contact me at the trading station in Emperor Mines when you have the money.</t>
 <t id="422610701">Lowerlife, I have made arrangements for your sorry carcass to be allowed access to our glorious space. Meet me at the trading station in Emperor Mines to discuss the details.</t>
 <t id="424611202">Your mine has been constructed and we have begun the mining operation.</t>
 <t id="424611301">The mining is proceeding on course. Nolmancketnun has asked me to order lowerlife to return to the mine immediately so that they may witness Nolmancketnun's success.</t>
 <t id="424611302">Unholy one, I have been assigned the task of helping your pitiful self by overseeing the mining procedure. We are currently loading the Mine onto our ship in Paranid Prime and shall leave for the specified destination shortly.</t>
 <t id="427611901">By order of his magnificence the Pontifex Maximus Paranidia, all Paranid installations are closed to non-Paranids. Do Not Attempt to Dock. No Further Communication is desired.</t>
 <t id="911610201">I thought we were going to Emperor Mines to meet your contact? So, where are you heading, JB?</t>
 <t id="911610601">How are you doing with the credits? %d thousand's a lot to find, so remember to check behind the padding on your flightseat and in the pockets of your dirty flightsuits. I'm having a lot of fun on the station in Emperor Mines. You know once you get to know them some Paranid have got a wicked sense of humour.</t>
 <t id="911611011">I'm at the mine in Priest Rings. Nolman did a good job with it and its operational. I'll meet you here.</t>
 <t id="911611201">They're getting close to breaking through, you got that factory ready?</t>
 <t id="911611202">Your mine has been constructed and we have begun the mining operation.</t>
 <t id="911611701">The Paranid are starting to ask questions about the Seed, JB, the sooner you get that crystal Fab here and we can leave, the better.</t>
 <t id="911611702">Do you have the Seed, JB? You'd better not forget about me, I'm still on the Trading Dock in Emperor Mines. Pick me up when you have the Seed.</t>
 <t id="912610004">Ion says the Seed can be found inside an asteroid in Priest Rings. However, as the Paranid borders are still closed, only Paranid can build mines there. You'll have to find a way to persuade someone to help you.</t>
 <t id="912610005">Once you have, you will need to build a super-factory, the details of which are attached to this message. All the information we have about the seed is that it is some sort of high energy vortex. A vortex powerful enough to tear a hole in space, so be cautious!</t>
 <t id="912610006">Ion has given this information very easily and we know nothing of this creature who he claims tricked him, so be wary, Julian. I feel in my heart that this Sargon cannot be Sohnen, they were peaceful and there are no reports of them manipulating other races. May you tread the path of wisdom with your eyes open.</t>
 <t id="912612001">Brennansama, you must build the whole complex - [Add list of components here] on LSWM - 2610 an asteroid in Priest Rings to get the Seed that Sargon seeks. We must know what this thing is. All Ion knows is that it is some kind of energy hub, so please be careful with it. It contains great power.  Who knows, with your help we may discover a secret we have sought for centuries.</t>

 <t id="710010">Ban is preparing a ship for scanning the Paranid installations. He will contact me again when the ship is ready.</t>
 <t id="720010">Kyle is onboard the Argon One in Argon Prime. I should go talk to him and Ban Danna.</t>
 <t id="720020">We scanned the first installation but there were no traces of Nividium there. Next is the Nividium Processing Plant in Paranid Prime.</t>
 <t id="720030">No Nividium in the second Plant, what did the Paranid do with it? We should go to Duke's Domain to check out the third one.</t>
 <t id="720040">I should return to Argon Prime and talk to Ban Danna immediately.</t>
 <t id="750010">I've captured a Paranid Patrol Ship which enables me to actually see the cloaked station in Duke's Domain. Miria and I are trying to take down the cloak by destroying its generators.</t>
 <t id="119710004">Julian, I have news of your father. He regained consciousness during the Kha'ak attack on Argon Prime, but before I could speak to him he stole a ship and left the station. His doctors have evidence that at the moment the Kha'ak arrived, his brainwaves matched the pattern of the Kha'ak jump events. I'm afraid word of this has got back to the senate. Senator McCarthy thinks he is being influenced by the Kha'ak and has ordered that Kyle must be found and, if he refuses to return, the search party has permission to fire on him.</t>
 <t id="119710005">I can't delay the search fleet forever, but I can give you a headstart. Before he went, your father looked up files on the AP Gunner. As you know he was looking for the Gunner before he disappeared, so I believe he's headed where you found it in Nyana's Hideout. We have to know what's important about that ship and what he discovered about the Kha'ak.</t>
 <t id="119710006">Find him and bring him home safe, Julian. I can't believe your father would betray us.</t>
 <t id="119710201">I will have to pass this information on to Argon Central very soon. Find him fast, Julian.</t>
 <t id="119711001">The search fleet is on its way. They know where Kyle was headed. You must intercept him before they do.</t>
 <t id="119720001">Eagle Flight notified me that they linked up with you. I'm glad to hear Kyle is well. Please return to Argon One as soon as possible.</t>
 <t id="119720101">Your father has returned to Argon One with some very important information. Based on this I have an urgent mission for you. Please return to Argon One as soon as possible.</t>
 <t id="119720232">Julian. The ship is ready. Please return to Argon One.</t>
 <t id="119722801">Julian, please return to Argon One immediately. There have been some developments.</t>
 <t id="119722901">Julian, please return to Argon One immediately. The Paranid Empire has declared you a criminal for the murder of Armanckessilon and for the theft of the Seed. It looks like Argon will also agree to declare you a criminal. You need to return here as soon as possible so we can sort this out.</t>
 <t id="119723001">Julian, the Argon Senate has voted to declare you a criminal. Your assets have been frozen and if you do not return immediately, then steps will be taken to bring you to justice. You must return as soon as possible.</t>
 <t id="119723301">Julian, I have an idea how we can sort this whole mess out. Please return to Argon One now.</t>
 <t id="119730701">Julian, I've had to use secure channels to send you this message. The senate have now declared you renegade, so you'll have to stay out of sight of Argon and Paranid installations. Both governments are talking to the other races and it won't be long before at least the Boron also declare you renegade. The only way out of this is for you to find out what the Paranid are doing and why.</t>
 <t id="119730702">Hopefully, by now you've met up with the Don. He'll help you get what you need. I think your instincts about a cloaking device are correct. It's not something we've been able to achieve, but there have been rumours of the Paranid succeeding. We'd been wondering how they managed it and you're right, the probability is it was with help from this alien 'Sargon'. The question is - why Sargon suddenly chose to stop working with the Paranid and go to Ion instead.</t>
 <t id="119730703">However they built the cloaking device, it will have been expensive and it will require huge amounts of energy to maintain, so whatever they are doing it must be worth a lot to them.</t>
 <t id="119730704">By the way, the senate has also insisted that we return the Seed. The Paranid are sending a convoy to pick it up.</t>
 <t id="119730705">Find out what they're doing, Julian and come back when you can prove it. Good luck!</t>
 <t id="815730801">You wise up and realise you need our help, you find us in Farnham's legend.</t>
 <t id="815731001">I better warn you, the Argon authorities they got a lead on you. They're checking your false ID after it was registered somewhere. As soon as they crack it they be after you, so you better get your space cadet bastu to my base in Farnham's legend!</t>
 <t id="815751201">You want to make more enemies? That's my jumpship and I want it back you piece of crazola.</t>
 <t id="816740304">You forgotten you a wanted man? You forgotten everyone trying to kill you? Get your bastu back here, JB.</t>
 <t id="816740305">We in Priest Rings. You want us to bring you a souvenir, or are you going to get your lousy carras back into this sector?</t>
 <t id="816750101">You want a jump drive, or not? Meet me at home in Farnham's Legend.</t>
 <t id="816750601">Where you go, JB? We have to try to uncloak this station, it's the only thing we can do to find anything out at the moment. Get your bastu back to Duke's Domain right now!</t>
 <t id="816750701">We're in sector Heretic's End you better catch up with us as soon as you can, JB.</t>
 <t id="816760002">We're out on the 'East'side of Heretic's End. You gotta see this, JB.</t>
 <t id="911720401">You could've installed some more leisure stuff on this ship, JB. I'm getting really bored. In short, GET YOUR BASTU BACK HERE AND PICK ME UP!</t>
 <t id="911722701">Well, thanks for the excitement, JB. Great day out almost getting killed, then ditched for another ship - thanks. Wise up, get back here and let's get back to Ban Danna!</t>
 <t id="911722702">I've taken the ship and headed back to Argon One. Meet me back there as soon as you can and, oh, better bring some credits, you owe me at least a drink!</t>
 <t id="911723401">We need to head for Emperor Mines, I think that's the best place to start, I'll give you more information once we get there. I've had a look at this equipment...they must be stretched at Argon command - it's ancient! We're going to have to get close to whatever we scan to get any readings.</t>

 <t id="6513">Rapier Missile</t>
 <t id="6514">Fresh from the drawing boards of the Argon Military Research Labs, the Rapier missile can acquire and lock down targets at speed, launching a devastating albeit relatively weak attack against an enemy vessel, far faster than many pilots reflexes. Used in close-range combat, often in numbers, as well as through medium range evasive routines, this device is considered to be an essential backup to any standard array of laser weaponry. </t>
 <t id="6519">There is no description available for this missile in the ship computer database.</t>
 <t id="6523">Firelance Missile</t>
 <t id="6524">The Firelance Missile was developed by the Paranid Military, however this missile was phased out of service. Some stockpiles were not accounted for after decommissioning, and have yet to be found.</t>
 <t id="6533">Wildfire Missile</t>
 <t id="6534">The Wildfire missile is a prototype missile developed by the Industritech Corporation before the Kha'ak attacks. However a production stage has not yet been reached. Some missiles have reportedly gone missing, but official sources have denied that this is the case.</t>
 <t id="6543">Windstalker Missile</t>
 <t id="6544">One of the most powerful missiles in the synaptic range, the Windstalker has been proven to bring an edge to any combat pilot's weapons portfolio. Good speed and yield make this missile a wise choice for attack runs and interception of mid-range craft. Where covert operations without scanner use are required, the Windstalker is unsurpassed. </t>
 <t id="6553">Banshee Missile</t>
 <t id="6554">A powerful military-grade medium range image-recognition missile, the Banshee offers pilots the chance to show their enemies the true meaning of fear. While not the fastest missile available, its yield and strong acquisition ability allow it to be used in a wide range of combat scenarios against medium to heavy fighters. </t>

 <t id="6731">Firefly Missile Factory</t>
 <t id="6732">This factory produces the Firefly Missile. A standard dumbfire missile.</t>
 <t id="6733">Firefly Missile</t>
 <t id="6734">With combat increasingly being fought at ever closer range, Argon Military specialists turned to the development of a more straightforward technology that did not require the advanced guidance systems of other missile units. The result was the Firefly Missile, a small, extremely fast projectile. With a high exit velocity and single trajectory, it is a one shot one chance armament.</t>
 <t id="6741">Thunderbolt Missile Factory</t>
 <t id="6742">This factory produces the Thunderbolt Missile. A Heat seeking armament that uses inbuilt guidance systems to lock on to heat signatures on both visible and infra-red spectrums.</t>
 <t id="6743">Thunderbolt Missile</t>
 <t id="6744">The Thunderbolt Heatseeker Missile uses inbuilt guidance systems to lock on to heat signatures on both visible and infra-red spectrums. Doing so allows it to track targets in areas where doing so would otherwise be impossible. Classically used when engaging multiple targets at distance, though pilots have since found other more ingenious uses for them.</t>
 <t id="6751">Tempest Missile Factory</t>
 <t id="6752">This factory produces the Tempest Missile. A Friend/Foe armament that will target its nearest enemy and change its target if the initial target is lost.</t>
 <t id="6753">Tempest Missile</t>
 <t id="6754">Dependent on the ship computer of the vessel it was launched on, the Tempest Missile scans for enemy targets and establishes priority of attack. In doing so, if the primary target is lost, it will immediately lock down the secondary, and so on, until it either runs out of fuel, or makes contact.</t>
 <t id="6761">Hurricane Missile Factory</t>
 <t id="6762">This factory produces the Hurricane Missile. A Proximity Charge device that will explode when near to your target, causing area-wide damage.</t>
 <t id="6763">Hurricane Missile</t>
 <t id="6764">After some concern that this armament would be nothing more than a continuation of the SQUASH Mine's unethical usage, the Hurricane Missile firmly rooted itself in military circles as being the weapon-of-choice when dealing with large numbers of small targets. Perfect for both Kha'ak cluster engagements as well as Pirate raid units.</t>
 <t id="6771">Blizzard Missile Factory</t>
 <t id="6772">This factory produces the Blizzard Missile. A tracker missile that splits into several independent units that will track separate enemies using your ship-computer's friend or foe signatures.</t>
 <t id="6773">Blizzard Missile</t>
 <t id="6774">The Blizzard Missile offers combatants the ability to effectively deal with multiple targets with the use of one missile. While not as powerful as a one-shot direct unit, the missile will split into several independent components that will track separate enemies using your ship-computer's friend or foe signatures.</t>
 <t id="6781">Cyclone Missile Factory</t>
 <t id="6782">This factory produces the Cyclone Missile. A Proximity Image Recognition missile.</t>
 <t id="6783">Cyclone Missile</t>
 <t id="6784">Similar to the Blizzard, the Cyclone Missile offers the same ability to deal with multiple targets with one armament. Again not as powerful as a one-shot direct unit, the missile will split into several smaller units that will engage image recognition tracking to lock down confirmed enemies in the field of engagement.</t>
 <t id="6791">Tornado Missile Factory</t>
 <t id="6792">This factory produces the Tornado Missile. A dumbfire swarm missile.</t>
 <t id="6793">Tornado Missile</t>
 <t id="6794">The Tornado Missile improves on the one-shot one-chance performance of the Firefly by overpowering the target with a swarm of missiles. Using an array of armaments, the Tornado is launched either simultaneously, or in swift succession, allowing the pilot to strafe the target with a battery of attacks.</t>
 <t id="6801">Typhoon Missile Factory</t>
 <t id="6802">This factory produces the Typhoon Missile. A swarm missile that makes use of an Image Recognition system.</t>
 <t id="6803">Typhoon Missile</t>
 <t id="6804">Holding more accuracy than the Firefly, the Typhoon Missile again allows multiple armaments to be launched at the same target, however with the addition of Image Recognition tracking, the possibility of success has been raised substantially. Again launching simultaneously or in succession, the pilot has the option to fire when not directly pointed at the target at hand.</t>
 <t id="6811">Firestorm Torpedo Factory</t>
 <t id="6812">This factory produces the Firestorm Torpedo. A high yield torpedo for use against capital ships and stations.</t>
 <t id="6813">Firestorm Torpedo</t>
 <t id="6814">One of the slowest and most powerful projectile weapons in the current batch of armaments used, the Firestorm Torpedo holds devastating destructive force at the expense of speed and manoeuvrability. While remarkably easy to shoot down, if successful, this weapon can yield great damage to a station, and in volume, even destroy it. Its success against large combat craft can be equally devastating when employed on close range attack runs.</t>
 <t id="6821">Aurora Missile Factory</t>
 <t id="6822">This factory produces the Aurora Synaptic Missile. A new technology that allows detonation of the missile to be controlled by the pilot.</t>
 <t id="6823">Aurora Missile</t>
 <t id="6824">The Aurora is classed as a Synaptic Detonator missile, a new and revolutionary technology that allows the pilot to choose when to detonate his missile to the split second of pressing the trigger. The pilot first fires his missile and then uses the fire missile trigger again to detonate the missile before the onboard timer expires.</t>
 <t id="6831">Remote Guided Warhead Factory</t>
 <t id="6832">This factory produces the remote guided warhead.</t>
 <t id="6833">Remote Guided Warhead</t>
 <t id="6834">The Remote Guided Warhead is designed to be part missile and part drone. It is fired normally however the pilot can take remote control to position the missile into an accurate firing line.</t>
 <t id="6841">Wasp Missile Factory</t>
 <t id="6842">This factory produces the Wasp Missile. A swarm missile that makes use of an Image Recognition system.</t>
 <t id="6843">Wasp Missile</t>
 <t id="6844">The Wasp Missile was remodelled for use against the Kha'ak and was the prototype for the Swarm Image Recognition tracking. Launching missiles simultaneously or in succession, the pilot has the option to fire when not directly pointed at the target at hand.</t>
 <t id="6851">Dragonfly Missile Factory</t>
 <t id="6852">This factory produces the Dragonfly Missile. A standard dumbfire missile.</t>
 <t id="6853">Dragonfly Missile</t>
 <t id="6854">Before developing the Firefly missile, the Argon Military refitted the Dragonfly missile with dumbfire protocols to greatly reduce the cost of manufacturing. The dumbfire Dragonfly replaces the now obsolete original. It continues in service to this day.</t>
 <t id="6991">Ranger</t>
 <t id="6992">The Goner Ranger is one of few ships known to be in use by the Goners. Due to the peaceful nature of the Goners this ship holds no weaponry. The Ranger is quite fast and is also considered to be a good short-range freighter due to its cargo space. It is also capable of holding shields compatible with some M3 fighters. You will probably see this ship roaming the sectors spreading the word of the Goners and R.Gunne.</t>
 <t id="7001">Eclipse</t>
 <t id="7002">The Federal Argon Government commissioned Bala Gi Research Inc. to develop a heavy fighter, larger than the current Nova, to fulfil a wider range of roles. The result, the Eclipse, enjoys a larger cargo bay than the Nova, at the expense of some speed and manoeuvrability.  The Argon military are glad to welcome this craft to their arsenal, with some suggestion that a missile gunboat role may emerge for the Eclipse.</t>
 <t id="7011">Chimera</t>
 <t id="7012">The Split Chimera was developed by Bala Gi Research Inc. following a successful tender to produce a ship that gave better long-range performance over the Mamba. Split defence experts view the Chimera as a logical step to delivering a heavy fighter with enhanced load-carrying capability and endurance.</t>
 <t id="7021">Medusa</t>
 <t id="7022">The Paranid government, learning that Bala Gi Research Inc. was to develop enhanced heavy fighters for other races, asked the company to investigate new design options for a heavy fighter to provide load-carrying capacity enhancements over the Perseus. The Medusa was the result. This new design fills a number of capability gaps that exist within the Paranid fleet.</t>
 <t id="7031">LX</t>
 <t id="7032">Pilots brave enough to traverse Xenon space in recent mozuras have reported sighting a strange ship, larger than a Xenon L.  Defence experts have named it the LX.  The ship, appearing larger than its Xenon L counterpart, is assumed to have a larger cargo capacity, while being only marginally less swift and agile.</t>
 <t id="7041">Hyperion</t>
 <t id="7042">Once owned by the Pontifex Maximus Paranidia and sailed under the name 'Trinity', this unique vessel was a prototype for a new M7 class of ship.  The contract for the serial production of the ship was cancelled for financial reasons when the Paranid Defence Directorate decided to divert funds to its secret jumpgate project. The ship's awesome capabilities place it between an M6 and an M2-class vessel, its astounding design the ultimate in Paranid innovation.</t>

 <t id="30000">Ruined by dreams of avarice, this sector was originally claimed by a Teladi entrepreneur, eager to expand to ever greater frontiers. But within his investments at Grand Exchange lay the seeds of despair that eventually led to this sector being placed under auction, in the hope that salvation would be financial, if nothing more.</t>
 <t id="30001">Whether this sector was claimed through fate or fortune is still unknown. However rumour persists that the owner, of distant descent, came to its ownership through a journey many believed existed only in myth and legend. The future has yet to be written, but its foundations begin and end here, within these gates.</t>

 <t id="1030504">After the Kha'ak attack on President's End, a decision was made to improve the security of Argon home systems. A taskforce was assembled in The Wall and sent to Elena's Fortune. Orders were given to capture and retake the sector, after a Kha'ak attack decimated the pirate forces who had held control over the system for so long. Argon surveillance expeditions later discovered that the Kha'ak attack destroyed the gate leading to the neighbouring system of Olmancketslat's Treaty.</t>
 <t id="1030514">Discovered and claimed by the Paranid, Heretic's End was abandoned due to its distance from the rest of the Paranid Empire. Today it is used as a training area for Paranid pilots.</t>
 <t id="1030615">Goner prophets and mystics, their mission now complete, travel along a very different path to that of their forefathers. The burning prophecy that Nathan R Gunne's words once held is embodied in this sector, now home to an ever-increasing number of believers, intent on ensuring that the truth of Gunne's Crusade lives on in eternity. To that end, each new station is blessed and considered a distant annexe of the Goner Temple.</t>
 <t id="1030619">After a failed attempt at securing land from the Njy family, the Z'rt family had no choice but to look elsewhere. Rumours emerged over time that the Ryk family had discovered a new system which they were soon planning to occupy. However because of a lack of resources they kept such knowledge a closely guarded secret, - or so they thought. Acting upon data collected from their spies, the Z'rt family moved in quickly and established a colony, much to the Ryk family's anger.</t>
 <t id="1030620">After establishing their primary system to the anger of the Ryk family, the Z'rt patriarch gained the friendship of the Njy family and secured resources to establish their second system. Z'rt's Dominion was formed bordering a dangerous Xenon system.</t>
 <t id="1030621">Sector Is Not Recognised in the Database.</t>
 <t id="1030720">This newly discovered system shows that the Xenon are still a concern; the sector houses a secondary production facility for Xenon vessels and is home to a large defence force. Some speculate that a Xenon core system is nearby.</t>
 <t id="1030801">Increased Kha'ak activity has meant that the Paranid have made no move to reclaim this inhospitable sector and no other race has shown interest as it borders only Paranid space. Localised Yaki activity is also a negative point to consider, leading some to believe it is used as a Pirate or Yaki safe-haven.</t>
 <t id="1030805">Ex-racing pilot and wealthy entrepreneur, Ser Alman Jonferson used some of his vast financial fortune to help sponsor construction on one of the largest and most prestigious racing circuits available. Its proximity to the lawless pirate sectors does however make security in this sector an issue. Race events held here do make for some of the most interesting races in the league calendar.</t>
 <t id="1030806">After the battle in the sector known today as Nopileos' Memorial, the Xenon have used this sector as a junkyard, storing and recycling ships here. The coordinates for the gate to this sector were lost, but a recent survey by Argon Expeditionary forces have since rediscovered the gate's location.</t>
 <t id="1030818">Midnight Star was discovered by Argon Expeditionary Forces and named because of the angle at which the now colonised planet faces the sun, leaving one hemisphere in eternal darkness.</t>
 <t id="1030819">This sector was established shortly after the initial Kha'ak invasions, and was intended as a support sector for supplying food and minerals to other Argon colonies.</t>
 <t id="1030820">The Grand Exchange refers to the large skyscraper on the surface of Goldminer's Dream, the primary planet. The traders' exchange centre was supposed to control Teladi Company trade throughout the known universe. However repeated Kha'ak attacks on Teladi communications satellites halted the necessary communications.</t>
 <t id="1030901">This bleak region is home to the Yaki faction. Little else is known about this sector.</t>
 <t id="1030909">Sector Is Not Recognised in the Database.</t>
 <t id="1030920">Merchant Haven was established to be a major trade port for the new Teladi expansion campaign. However the plans failed when surprise attacks by hostile forces stopped the advance into nearby systems. The sector now serves the local Teladi population and trades with the nearby Argon and Split.</t>
 <t id="1031001">Mired in the torment of a war without honour, rumour suggests the Yaki have chosen this sector as a point of respite and for many of them, a place to call home.  Argon and Paranid scouts returning from missions have reported ships known to be of Yaki origin, patrolling both this and the adjacent sector of Ocracoke's Storm.  Clearly both sectors offer a battlefront upon which to launch further attacks, while protecting the dark secrets thought to dwell deep within the Badlands. The sector's name is a clear sign of defiance to the Argon and a warning of past mistakes for the Teladi.</t>
 <t id="1031019">Sector Is Not Recognised in the Database.</t>
 <t id="1031020">The Teladi discovered this sector shortly after they occupied the neighbouring Merchant Haven system. A strong magnetic storm blocked their sensors and a fleet of pirate vessels ambushed the explorers and destroyed their vessels. The Teladi have not returned.</t>
 <t id="1031119">Sector Is Not Recognised in the Database.</t>
 <t id="1031202">The leader of the Split family Rhy discovered and occupied this sector shortly after the Kha'ak invasions began. The sector was supposedly taken from the Kha'ak by the Rhy Family in an unconfirmed story.</t>
 <t id="1031502">The Boron sector of Shining Currents was founded as a food production centre to aid the continuing growth of the Boron Kingdom. The name comes from the reflection of the mercury ocean on the moon of the primary planet.</t>
 <t id="1031512">Sector Is Not Recognised in the Database.</t>
 <t id="1031603">The planet Elysium is described as a peaceful paradise world filled with lush plant life. The lowlands, however, are filled with a thick mist for half of the planet's day. This does not seem to worry the Boron, who remain at some distance within their deep-sea homes.</t>
 <t id="1031608">Sector Is Not Recognised in the Database.</t>
 <t id="1031609">This sector lies in low orbit of the hostile planet Xhar'Bar, where the Xaarist priests accused early colonists of not following the Paranid religion.</t>
 <t id="1031610">The fire pits of the planet of XaarXen were deemed to be holy by the priests of the Paranid Xaarist religion, after the original expedition vessel was consumed by a firestorm that formed from one of these pits.</t>

 <t id="10200">Check back regularly for all the latest business news concerning $SECTOR$ and surrounding areas. </t>
 <t id="10300">Surrounding sectors have reported a frenzied increase in traffic as ships struggle to reach $SECTOR$ to take advantage of the great prices. </t>
 <t id="10301">These events have given cause for many to believe that this may herald a new era for trade relations between $SECTOR$ and its neighbours. Those who believed otherwise appear to be in a now silent minority. </t>
 <t id="10302">Freighters are arriving at steadily increasing rates in the sector, loading up with as much stock as they can hold, with destinations as of yet unknown. Prices in neighbouring sectors remain steady despite the incredible offers currently available in $SECTOR$. </t>
 <t id="10303">While rumours of anything from a new Xenon war to discovery of new sectors has fuelled the success of the economy in $SECTOR$, we cannot help but think that there has to be something more mundane behind the situation that has arisen here. Supply and demand perhaps? </t>
 <t id="10304">With the demand for wares now falling steadily, both local and free traders are now taking advantage of declining prices. Profits have never been so good for those in $SECTOR$ who own a freighter and a pilot's licence. </t>
 <t id="10305">With prices having fallen to such a degree, Sector Patrols have noticed a marked decrease in pirate attacks as even known criminals decide that legally purchasing items would actually be cheaper than risking sector raids. </t>
 <t id="10400">There does not seem to be an end to the sector's good fortune, and while many may think that the profits made by those who trade in this area may be less than legal, nothing has been proven bar honest work and long stazuras spent in hangar bays and cockpits. </t>
 <t id="10401">We have seen countless traders spread across the sector who are clearly delighted at the turn of events to befall them. While many agree with us that these times will eventually come to an end, no one is willing to place a bet on when that time may come. </t>
 <t id="10402">Jumpgates remain in constant use as the sector works hard to process the traders working to cut a higher margin of profit on trades that are now becoming known across even more outlying regions. </t>
 <t id="10403">Having spent a considerable period of time with its people, we have seen a sector that has been transformed by the good fortune it has been struck by. Traders of all races have been happy to greet us, even talk for a while, and in this we have seen the true magic that profits can bring to a people, regardless of their origin in known space. </t>
 <t id="10404">After witnessing the good fortunes of many who pass through this sector, we have in turn decided to depart in search of further news to report to you, perhaps from those who have taken the profits they have made and turned them from dreams once cherished to reality. </t>
 <t id="10500">"It's been incredible! I've never known anything like this to have happened before. Certainly my shipmates don't recall such an event in near history either!" claimed $PERSON1$ who had just arrived at the station while we were investigating this story. </t>
 <t id="10501">"I didn't think I would see something like this in my lifetime. I remember our elders talking of times like these when I was very young. That they are upon us now, this surprises me," said $PERSON1$, a station manager still apparently in shock at being in the middle of such happenings. </t>
 <t id="10502">"We have seen so many workers who were clearly short of sleep and in need of replacement that we have stopped counting. The stress of the situation is indeed beginning to show, but one thing's for sure, profits have never been so good. We're selling like hellfire!" said $PERSON1$, a station manager clearly excited to be seeing such incredible business. </t>
 <t id="10503">"I'm thinking of taking the rest of the mazura off!" This from $PERSON1$, a trader we managed to talk to before boarding a well-stocked freighter, "I have enough credits profit to finally take the trip I've always wanted to. It's been a great time, I'm glad things are looking up for us here in $SECTOR$." </t>
 <t id="10504">"There are few things I could think of that make more people smile than the sound of credits rolling into your account. This mazura has been good to us all. I only wish we had more times like now." These words from $PERSON1$, a wistful station manager aged beyond jazuras through constant struggle, yet finally knowing things had indeed been worthwhile. </t>
 <t id="10505">"I haven't told my family yet," said $PERSON1$, a trader who was clearly unsure what to do with the additional profits made in the last few tazuras. "I know I'll take them to Apoch's Argnuburgers, but beyond that, maybe we should save for times that are not as good as these." </t>
 <t id="10506">"I've just finished loading up my freighter!" gasped $PERSON1$, a pilot we managed to catch for a few words before departure. "And you know what? It's full. And I don't mean half full, I mean full to capacity. I don't think I've ever been able to manage that before. My credits are certainly buying a great deal more than I remember!" </t>
 <t id="10507">After watching several freighter pilots dock at stations in $SECTOR$, we picked one out who looked particularly joyous, and decided to ask her why. "I talked to my partner today. I told him how many credits we'd made profit this mazura, and he started to weep with joy. It's not every tazura we make this kind of money, but when they come, we know our children will eat and out quarters will be warm. Simple things I know, but deep down, this is all that matters." </t>
 <t id="10508">"I'm starting to think that maybe I have a chance to go to Combat Academy after all. I've made enough through trading this mazura to pay my way through for at least the first jazura. I really can't wait to get my own fighter ship!" These words from $PERSON1$, a free trader who was offloading in $SECTOR$. </t>
 <t id="10509">"I'm not sure whether this is good for the sector in general, but I'm sure it's doing a great deal more for our pockets. Profits have never been this good!" said one free trader who had recently landed at a station in $SECTOR$ to load several ships to the bursting point with enough resources to stock a station for a wozura. </t>

 <t id="3010000">Solar Flares Spark Energy Boom in $SECTOR$</t>
 <t id="3010100">A sudden rise in solar activity has enabled Solar Power Plants to substantially accelerate their production rate. Station managers across the sector have reported in record yields with prices dropping to an all-time low. This has in turn created a chain-reaction with other stations throughout the sector recording a surge in production. </t>
 <t id="3020000">Discovery in $SECTOR$</t>
 <t id="3020100">Scientists have recently discovered another location for what may possibly be the first new resource to be of value in several Jazuras. Since the news was first published, $SECTOR$ has been flooded with requests for further information. While still unknown, it is believed the refinement of the resource yields massive amounts of energy cells, which has consequently sparked a rise in the production for all factories given the sudden abundance of energy now available for consumption in $SECTOR$. </t>
 <t id="3030000">Asteroid Provides Minerals!</t>
 <t id="3030100">Traders from $SECTOR$ are still coming to terms with the good fortune caused by recent events, with many now unsure whether to remain resident within the region after making such high profits. A rapidly disintegrating asteroid has left a field of debris sector-wide late last tazura. Scans taken have shown the asteroid to have contained a large concentration of $WARE$. The $GOVERNMENT1$ are unable to confirm the vector of its approach or why they were unable to detect its arrival. Freighters have spent the last few stazuras collecting as much of the free $WARE$ as possible to sell on to already overflowing factories. </t>
 <t id="3040000">Stockpiles of $WARE$ Grow in $SECTOR$</t>
 <t id="3040100">Manufacturers in $SECTOR$ have recently witnessed growing demand for the production of all wares. To compensate for this, stations have doubled shifts and drastically increased the amount of imported $WARE$ to ensure stock is kept in good supply. With the theory that it is better to have too much stock than none at all, turnover has reached unprecedented levels. Stations across the sector are experiencing surges in output due to the reduced downtime. </t>
 <t id="3050000">Apoch's ArgnuBurgers</t>
 <t id="3050100">The legendary cahoona burger merchants, Apoch's ArgnuBurgers, today suffered a setback when large volumes of cahoonas were marked as being unfit for the high quality required by the franchise and were returned to bakeries in $SECTOR$. While stocks of cahoonas returned for resale to less demanding customers have caused prices to plummet, Apoch's name still stands tall as a mark of true ArgnuBurger quality. </t>
 <t id="3060000">Record $WARE$ Output Predicted!</t>
 <t id="3060100">Station Owners in $SECTOR$ are preparing to line their pockets with credits after confirmation of an usually high output of $WARE$ for this season. Yields have been increased by up to 200% following an extended period of research by a group of $PEOPLE1$, who have yet to reveal or publish their scientific work formally. We have yet to confirm if the methods by which this boost has been gained are even legal in nature. </t>
 <t id="3070000">Markus Spaceflies Bring $SECTOR$ To Halt</t>
 <t id="3070100">Swarms of Markus spaceflies have recently caused problems for the $WARE$ industry in $SECTOR$, with stations seeing no more than half their original business levels. While the swarms have now dissipated, many pilots who work for the $WARE$ industry took time off to see and listen to the incredible sight of thousands of spaceflies moving in unison, and are now behind on their delivery schedules. Stocks are piling up with station managers dropping prices in an effort to lure buyers back in. </t>
 <t id="3080000">Production Booms For $SECTOR$</t>
 <t id="3080100">Stations producing $WARE$ in $SECTOR$ have dramatically ramped up production in an effort to ensure quotas are met before the end of the coming Mazura. Supplies of resources have remained steady with station owners even reportedly resorting to black market imports in order to keep production lines running.  Sharp investors will be able to make a higher than average margin while purchasing the surplus. </t>
 <t id="3090000">Sun Spots Spark Stockpiling in $SECTOR$</t>
 <t id="3090100">A number of particularly large sun spots were noted on a star in the region of $SECTOR$ in the last mazura. These have inevitably brought more business to the sector, as travellers came to watch the stunning aurora scattered throughout the sector. With the expected surge in solar activity now almost at its end, radiation bursts are returning back to nominal levels. Having worked to increase productivity in an effort to meet the extra demand the event has caused, station managers selling $WARE$s are now left with a modest surplus of stock which is being sold at a discount. </t>

 <t id="10101">$AUTHOR$, Assoc. Editor, GalNet Economic News</t>
 <t id="10102">$AUTHOR$, Field Reporter, GalNet Economic News</t>
 <t id="10200">Check back regularly for all the latest business news concerning $SECTOR$ and surrounding areas. </t>
 <t id="10300">With distribution cycles now in disarray, $SECTOR$ has seen the largest single drop in wares since records began. It is still unclear how many stations have been affected. Reports are still being collated from all locations. </t>
 <t id="10301">It is now believed that the loss of goods will have a serious impact on all other stations in the sector. Free traders are asked to help ensure disruption is kept to a minimum. If you can help, jump to $SECTOR$. </t>
 <t id="10302">Station owners have been rushing to us in the hope that we are able to offer support in this time of crisis, unfortunately all we could offer was a way to spread news of the plight many were now suffering. </t>
 <t id="10303">As we watched, ships from the far reaches of the galaxy were jumping in to offer support to those who were unable to deal with the crisis. Jostling for position in docking queues, some pilots were noticeably becoming quite agitated. </t>
 <t id="10304">Riots aboard a number of stations appear to have broken out, with local workers struggling to cope with the recent events that still appear to be unfolding before them. The $GOVERNMENT1$ are considering deploying additional patrols to the sector to prevent the unease from deteriorating into open combat. </t>
 <t id="10305">Many station owners have struggled to cope with the situation, unable to compensate for events they had never believed possible in such a secure area. TS Class vessels from a number of stations have been sent on long-distance missions in the hope that help will be received from friendly sectors further afield. </t>
 <t id="10306">Station owners have complained that they have not received adequate assistance from the $GOVERNMENT1$, who in their eyes, have had more than enough time to set up a plan to deal with the worsening events. </t>
 <t id="10307">An end to the current crisis is expected to be in sight. With many sectors now sending support and volunteers arriving in force to contribute to their aid, we hope those who have chosen to remain within $SECTOR$ will do so with peace of mind. </t>
 <t id="10308">While Sector Patrols have succeeded in maintaining peace in the area, there is still an air of unease surrounding the sector. Communications chatter remains subdued and tense. The $GOVERNMENT1$ have requested that any pilots willing to assist should jump to $SECTOR$. </t>
 <t id="10309">This has led to a sector-wide shortfall in production, with demand growing higher for wares by the Stazura. The $GOVERNMENT1$ have been slow to respond, with no clear plan of action having ever been made for such an event. </t>
 <t id="10310">As prices continue to rise, with many freighters now leaving barely carrying any cargo at all, those remaining are struggling to keep $SECTOR$ functioning. The $GOVERNMENT1$ have several scout ships deployed to ensure shipping lanes are kept clear to allow for assistance to be delivered to affected stations quickly. </t>
 <t id="10311">Across $SECTOR$, stations have been reporting that production cycles have been delayed and in some cases halted altogether. The stocks of many stations have been seriously affected. </t>
 <t id="10312">Workers' families have been boarding Liners at every available station in an effort to vacate the sector. Stations which are now at the point of being unable to support or pay their own staff are clearly feeling the pressure of the rapidly worsening situation. </t>
 <t id="10313">Across $SECTOR$, stocks of wares have fallen markedly. Many stations have seen spates of panic-buying not seen since the arrival of the Kha'ak. Several station owners have elected to enlist the aid of friendly stations from other sectors in order to alleviate the stress of the current crisis. </t>
 <t id="10314">Workers in $SECTOR$ have struggled to make contact with family members in other sectors. With lines of communication overloaded, networks have been unable to cope with the sudden surge in data traffic following the events. Prices are now so high few can hope to fill more than a third of their transporters' cargo capacity. </t>
 <t id="10315">TP Liners have struggled to cope with demand as those dealing with the crisis have attempted to escape with their families, no longer feeling safe or at ease in $SECTOR$ despite assurances from the $GOVERNMENT1$. </t>
 <t id="10316">With many aspects of $SECTOR$ virtually grinding to a halt, free traders have become more apparent as freighters from outlying sectors arrive to provide what little help they may be able to offer in this current crisis. </t>
 <t id="10317">Sector Patrols have relaxed their routine scanning patrols in an effort to entice less than legal transports into the sector, hoping they may also carry much needed supplies to stations where they are urgently required. </t>
 <t id="10318">Additional Liners have been called in from nearby sectors to help with the crisis, as well as transport those now wishing to leave $SECTOR$ in search of somewhere more stable to settle their families. </t>
 <t id="10319">The $GOVERNMENT1$ have struggled to make contact with stations as communications systems and satellites failed to withstand the resulting traffic caused by the recent events. </t>
 <t id="10400">It is unknown how long the current state of affairs is expected to last, but while news of the unfortunate events still spreads across known space, ships will continue to flood in from other sectors. </t>
 <t id="10401">Pirates and other mercenaries have attacked a number of ships in an attempt to capitalise on an already weakened sector. Many pilots have turned back in fear of being unable to reach their destination without their ship being captured, or worse, their crew killed. </t>
 <t id="10402">Sector Patrols are estimating that the amount of patrols needed to ensure peace is upheld may need to be raised by a significant percent over the coming Mazura. It is only a matter of time before the $GOVERNMENT1$ either take control of the situation or allow it to develop into the worst crisis since the arrival of the Kha'ak. </t>
 <t id="10403">With so much upheaval in such a relatively short space of time, no one is sure whether we have yet to see the worst of this crisis. One can only hope an end is in sight. </t>
 <t id="10404">Restoration of services is expected to be completed within the next two wozuras. The doubt however remains that events such as these, while rare, will in time occur again. The only question is when. </t>
 <t id="10405">No one is certain yet what has caused the events we have described here. Superstitions still remain active, with some firmly believing the Ancients are punishing the sector for reasons only they know. </t>
 <t id="10406">Several stations have already begun preparing for what may well be a lengthy period of uncertainty. Non-essential staff have been relocated and families of crew transported to surrounding sectors. </t>
 <t id="10407">Inhabitants have been urged not to make any future travel plans or make journeys without prior authorisation from authorities unless absolutely essential. The $GOVERNMENT1$ are currently working hard to ensure the safety of all personnel and travellers within the sector. </t>
 <t id="10408">The $GOVERNMENT1$ have requested workers to remain calm during this stressful period. Additional Sector Patrols have been enlisted to cope with the additional demands from incoming traffic destined for stations inside the sector. </t>
 <t id="10409">No one knows how long the current crisis will continue, but it seems that regardless of species or location, times such as these befall all of us sooner or later. Many stations are now on high alert for further problems that may become apparent in the coming tazuras. </t>
 <t id="10410">The rumoured arrival of a strong military fleet has caused some concern amongst civilian inhabitants, with many feeling that the events that have taken place so far have yet to reach their peak. </t>
 <t id="10411">Friends and family of those within the sector are understandably concerned for their welfare given the sudden jump in market prices. Many believe they will no longer be able to afford the cost of supporting both themselves and those further afield. The $GOVERNMENT1$ have assured inhabitants that as soon as they have control of the crisis, and clear lines of command, normal operations will resume. </t>
 <t id="10412">It may be some time before the true nature of the events becomes clear. By that time though, it may be too late for those who suffer, perhaps in silence, within the sector. With credits running low, few are forecasting that the coming mazuras will be much better. </t>
 <t id="10413">It may be some time before the events unfolding in the sector can play out to their conclusion. While their outcome is unsure, what you can be sure of is that we will be there to ensure you receive the most up-to-date news possible. </t>
 <t id="10414">While no one has been openly pointing fingers at the $GOVERNMENT1$ yet, there still remains a group of people who believe that something could have been done to prevent the events that have shook the sector with such violence. </t>
 <t id="10415">With no clear sign that the current events are coming to an end, many workers are contemplating taking extended leave or relocating to sectors that do not seem to be as cursed as this one. </t>
 <t id="10416">It may be some time before the full extent of the losses are known, however we are already seeing a sector that is suffering both in the loss of its people's livelihoods, and to a lesser extent the loss of its productivity. </t>
 <t id="10500">One trader, $PERSON1$, spoke to us of his worries, "how will we ever know our families are safe and secure while we are away? I have lost more than my livelihood today, I have lost my peace of mind concerning those who are near to me, the people I love." </t>
 <t id="10501">"We're having to do everything we can to make sure everyone who has been affected is not left without support," said $PERSON1$, a busy Station Manager, "but it's not like we mind, this affects us all." </t>
 <t id="10502">One worker aboard the station we visited was clearly concerned. "We're not sure how long this is going to last or whether our future is secure. What will I tell my family?" </t>
 <t id="10503">"It's crazy!" said $PERSON1$, a Station Manager we contacted at the main Trade Station. "We don't have the resources to cope with this kind of crisis! I don't know how long it's going to be before someone takes control of the situation! Whether I'll be here when that happens I'm not sure." </t>
 <t id="10504">"We just don't want to take the risk anymore! We keep hearing bad rumours about this sector, and in space a rumour is as good as the truth," said one freighter captain who was unwilling to be named. </t>
 <t id="10505">"I don't think this could be any worse," said $PERSON1$, a Station Manager struggling to come to terms with the enormity of the disaster. "I have lost several of my crew, including their families, they've worked for us for so long and now we can't even afford to pay them." </t>
 <t id="10506">"I didn't know what to do when I heard the news come through! All I could do was try and sell as much of my freight as people would take. I kept wondering whether my family would be able to eat with fewer credits coming in. Thankfully they will." This from $PERSON1$, a clearly relieved pilot who had only just docked in $SECTOR$. </t>
 <t id="10507">"Look around you. We're all but dead in the water here. If we don't leave and find work elsewhere, our families will starve." These words from $PERSON1$, a distraught worker who was preparing to leave on the next TP Liner as we spoke. "I don't know where we'll go, but anywhere is better than here right now." </t>
 <t id="10508">"I can't keep up with this! I don't know what's going to happen next but I'm not sure I want to be here when it does. All I want is somewhere quiet and safe to keep my family, somewhere I don't have to worry about things like this," mentioned $PERSON1$, a pilot who clearly needed both a wash and some recovery time. </t>
 <t id="10509">"I'm okay and I think my job's secure for now, but my family lives several sectors away. They don't know what's going on and I can't get through to them to tell them. Would you pass this message on to them?" said $PERSON1$, who spoke to us before having to return to work. We have of course passed on his personal transmission. </t>
 <t id="10510">"I'm not sure what's in store for us next. What I do know is that I'm ready and my family are safe and will be provided for. That's really all that matters to me," said $PERSON1$, a Station Manager who had just completed stocking the cargo bays with enough resources to last through the Mazura. </t>
 <t id="10511">"We didn't think it would be a good idea if we stayed. So we packed what we had and grabbed the next transport that arrived. Looking back, I think we did the right thing," said the father of one family who was clearly glad to have left when he did. </t>
 <t id="10512">"I've already lost half of my profits from this mazura, I'm not willing to risk any more, and certainly not the security of my family or workers. We'll run at half capacity until we're sure this is all over," said $PERSON1$, a Station Manager who was clearly unhappy about the situation. </t>
 <t id="10513">"I moved here because I thought we were safe from these kinds of events. Thinking back, perhaps we would have been safer where we were. You can never truly escape incidents such as these. So much has been lost here, so many hurt." These words from $PERSON1$, who was preparing to board a Liner with what remained of his family. "My wife, I don't know where she is. Someone said she had already left. But where I don't know." </t>
 <t id="10514">"I've seen some horrific things, like the Noodle Uprising of 762, but this just beats them all," rambled $PERSON1$, a well respected old-timer from the area. "People are going to have nightmares about this one for jazuras, mark my words." </t>

 <t id="2010000">example of event 1 specific text</t>
 <t id="3010000">Solar Storm Damages Stations in $SECTOR$</t>
 <t id="3010100">Solar storms have battered Solar Power Plants in $SECTOR$, damaging energy storage facilities as well as overloading internal station components. Many are now without adequate station management systems. At this time, virtually all of the Solar Power Plants in the sector are either down or producing at a substantially reduced rate. It will take some time before they are restored to normal operating status. </t>
 <t id="3020000">Defective Energy Cells Cripple $SECTOR$</t>
 <t id="3020100">In a staggering series of events, Station Managers in $SECTOR$ discovered to their complete dismay that over half of the stored Energy Cells in the sector were defective.  The source of the defective energy is unclear at this time, but Station Managers have agreed to meet to discuss possible changes to the obviously inadequate quality inspections that currently take place. The effect on the sector economy due to lost production time is projected to be catastrophic. </t>
 <t id="3030000">Miners Revolt in $SECTOR$</t>
 <t id="3030100">Miners in $SECTOR$, upset about the latest disputes between union leaders and station owners, have finally taken to striking and even sabotaging quantities of produced $WARE$. Other stations in the sector are now experiencing difficulties due to the lack of useable $WARE$ to feed into production lines. It is not clear when a settlement will be reached with the rebellious miners, but many hope it will be before conditions degrade any further. </t>
 <t id="3040000">Resources Depleted, Sector In Shock</t>
 <t id="3040100">After an exceptionally busy period within $SECTOR$, Station Managers are finding their resources stretched to breaking point. While the root cause is still unknown, it is now apparent that a sector-wide shortage of $WARE$ now exists. Many stations are now turning to sectors several jumps away from their normal sources in the hope that the lack of resources will be relieved. </t>
 <t id="3050000">Parasites Consume $WARE$</t>
 <t id="3050100">Parasites have been detected in supplies of $WARE$ throughout $SECTOR$. Station Managers are livid at watching their stores literally eaten out from underneath them. Cleaning these parasites out has become a top priority for all concerned in the sector. In addition, the $GOVERNMENT1$ have confirmed that stores have fallen to such a degree that any free traders who are able to bring stocks of $WARE$ to the sector will be welcomed enthusiastically. </t>
 <t id="3060000">Famine in $SECTOR$, Assistance Urgently Required!</t>
 <t id="3060100">It is thought that close to 15% of the inhabitants of $SECTOR$ are malnourished or living in fear that remaining food supplies will soon disappear. With lack of support from the $GOVERNMENT1$ or the presence of free traders, the population of $SECTOR$ are unable to maintain anything more than a trickle of food stocks from outlying sectors. No significant supplies of $WARE$ have been seen for close to two Mazuras. We have registered consistently low levels of stock in all stations visited in the sector. </t>
 <t id="3070000">Strange Nebula Disrupts $SECTOR$</t>
 <t id="3070100">Scientists are completely baffled by a dramatic, short term increase in nebulae gas within $SECTOR$. With countless freighters and patrol craft unable to navigate effectively, shipping lines have been temporarily disrupted, and supplies of $WARE$ within stations seriously affected. A number of collisions have already been reported with some incidents between different races escalating to open combat. Station managers have reported rampant theft of remaining supplies as less than honest individuals take advantage of the confusion to try to acquire the $WARE$ by any means necessary. </t>
 <t id="3080000">Unknown Virus Grips Inhabitants of $SECTOR$</t>
 <t id="3080100">Workers at stations producing $WARE$ within $SECTOR$ are reported to have been taken ill with what may possibly be the worst outbreak of Argon Flu yet. Close to 450 workers have been affected at this time, with the number increasing as this news goes out. The $GOVERNMENT1$ are considering a quarantine for station workers until the source can be established. The origin of the outbreak has not yet been traced, but speculation is that something abnormal in the $WARE$ being produced is to blame. Further production has been temporarily halted until the source of the illness has been determined. </t>
 <t id="3090000">Explosions Rock $SECTOR$</t>
 <t id="3090100">Several explosions of unknown origin tore through $SECTOR$ late in the last tazura, throwing ships off course and causing minor damage to stations throughout the sector. The origin of the explosions is unclear, but it appears to be no coincidence that only stations storing $WARE$ were affected. Casualty figures appear to be negligible due to the improved storage bay shielding recently installed on all stations, but inhabitants are concerned that this might have been caused by a deliberately sabotaged shipment of wares and are suspicious that this may signal possible further attacks in the future. </t>
 <t id="3100000">Odnol Iralom Strikes Again</t>
 <t id="3100100">After a period of relative peace, it appears the notorious trickster Odnol Iralom has indeed struck again, this time in $SECTOR$ during the last tazura. Disguised as a simpleton with an infinite number of mundane questions, Iralom succeeded in keeping station managers so busy that several containers worth of $WARE$s were unloaded from cargo bays and removed without notice. Sector Patrols are currently searching for Odnol after being notified of the thefts by embarrassed and somewhat confused station workers, many unable to understand exactly what had happened. </t>

 <t id="10100">$AUTHOR$, Senior Kha'ak Analyst, GalNet News</t>
 <t id="10200">"I don't want this to be the end of us. Not like this." These words from $PERSON1$, a worker stationed at $THISSTATION$. "My partner is working on another station, I know she's in just as much danger as I am, but that doesn't make it any better." $PERSON1$ was clearly concerned over the situation, refusing to continue work until the threat had been neutralised. </t>
 <t id="10201">Workers across $PEOPLE1$ sectors remain in peril as combat forces struggle to protect both freighters and stations from the threat of Kha'ak weapons technology. One worker, $PERSON1$, who looked particularly perturbed, took time out to say a few words to our reporter. "I know they're doing their best out there, and I salute them, but I don't feel safe here on $THISSTATION$, I'd rather be much farther away. I wish they'd let us leave. I'd rather take my chances out there in my ship than stuck here sitting pretty." </t>
 <t id="10202">While reporting from $THISSTATION$, we managed to get a few words from the partner of a patrol fighter pilot of the $GOVERNMENT1$. "It doesn't seem real. I mean I know he's out there, that he's fighting them off with the rest of our combat pilots. But when I look out there, I don't want to think of him not coming back to me. Why won't they just leave us alone? What do they want from us?" We chose not to continue our report with her due to the evident strain the situation was causing. Our thoughts and prayers go out to all affected by the current conflict. </t>
 <t id="10203">"I've never been this close to them. The sound they make, the way their weapons buzz. I don't like it." These words from $PERSON1$, the general manager of $THISSTATION$. Having halted production to allow for staff to be secured in areas that were away from possible impact points, the most he was able to do was stand and stare, silently praying that the sound and heat of Kha'ak firepower would not turn in our direction. "We all seem to be at the mercy of the $GOVERNMENT1$'s Military forces, I hope this is a battle we can win." </t>
 <t id="10300">"We did it! I can't believe we're still here to say that!" These words from $PERSON1$ rang out amongst the cheers and adulation that filled $THISSTATION$ and countless others in the sector as news spread of the destruction of numerous Kha'ak vessels that had previously entered the area. With debris rapidly being cleared, a feeling of relief had spread like a wave as traders rushed to return to their normal routines. </t>
 <t id="10301">As word spread of the success of the mission against the Kha'ak incursion, $PERSON1$, a worker stationed at $THISSTATION$ shouted across to us his clear delight that we were all still alive. "It's incredible! Did you see how they cut through those Kha'ak like they were bofu!? It's like we had some kind of new weapons technology or something, incredible I say!" Regardless of the manner by which the Kha'ak were disposed of, the feeling of relief has indeed been overwhelming. </t>
 <t id="10302">"He's coming back to me. I know he is. I just heard word that the last of the Kha'ak have been destroyed and that he was safe. I'm so glad to know this is all over." These words from a clearly relieved relative of one of the $GOVERNMENT1$ Patrol Forces pilots, who had engaged and held off Kha'ak vessels from attacking trade points until military units had been scrambled. There have been many acts of valour today, some will have gone unnoticed, but they have all counted towards a victory that will long be remembered. </t>

 <t id="2010000">Kha'ak Detected in $SECTOR1$!</t>
 <t id="2010100">We are currently working to confirm reports of Kha'ak activity in the sector of $SECTOR1$. $GOVERNMENT1$ patrols have spotted $NUMKHAAK$ in total at the time of this transmission. We ask all traders within this area to remain calm. Do not attempt to undertake journeys that may vector into Kha'ak spawn positions. Combat veterans are currently closing in on the Kha'ak positions, weapons-free and authorised to engage at will. Further updates will be made shortly. </t>
 <t id="2010101">A number of stations in $SECTOR1$ have transmitted urgent requests for assistance and protection following the appearance of Kha'ak vessels in their proximity. We urge all those who are in the area to remain calm. Patrols have been able to confirm the presence of $NUMKHAAK$ at the time of this transmission. Further updates will be made as and when we have more news. Military and combat units are on course to intercept and will engage shortly. </t>
 <t id="2010102">Combat awareness alerts have been issued for $SECTOR1$ following the detection of a number of Kha'ak vessels en route to coordinates well within the main trading matrix of that sector. Both free traders and military patrols have at this time marked a total of $NUMKHAAK$ on full thrust and vectoring for attack. All civilian craft are urged to take evasive action immediately and clear combat hotspots for military engagement. Updates on the situation will be made on further news from $GOVERNMENT1$ Patrol Units. </t>
 <t id="2020000">Victory Won Against Kha'ak Forces!</t>
 <t id="2020100">After a battle which ended with the loss of several combat veterans, it is now known that $KILLER$ launched a stunning attack run that resulted in the destruction of the Kha'ak vessel. While suffering major ship damage and plasma burns from ruptured thrust chambers, our hero still maintained course and launched a payload of weaponry that put an end to the reign of terror the Kha'ak thought would last forever within $SECTOR1$. $KILLER$, on behalf of the $GOVERNMENT1$, we salute you, and all your kind. You are a credit to your race. Long may your heroism live on in the memories of all those you have saved through your selfless actions.  </t>
 <t id="2020101">We have received notification that a Capital class Kha'ak Warship has been destroyed by $KILLER$ after an intense engagement in the heart of $SECTOR1$. While enemy units are still marked for elimination by sector forces, it is believed that the battle is being won, albeit slowly. Our prayers are with you, for all those currently in combat, or supporting those who are fighting to keep our frontiers safe, may you be homewards bound soon.  </t>
 <t id="2020102">With the conflict in $SECTOR1$ starting to abate, multiple Kha'ak units are confirmed to have been neutralised at this time. While $SECTOR1$ is still weapons free and will remain so as long as there are enemy vessels in the area, the main threats appear to have been eliminated. $KILLER$ is reported to have single-handedly turned the tide of the battle by eliminating a Capital-class warship.  $GOVERNMENT1$ Patrols have confirmed they will continue to engage with all Kha'ak vessels in conjunction with the strong military presence. We hope to bring you news of further success in good time. </t>
 <t id="2030000">Kha'ak Ships Moving Towards $SECTOR2$</t>
 <t id="2030100">Reports are coming in that one of the Kha'ak Vessels, possibly an M1 or M2, previously reported to have jumped into $SECTOR1$ is now on a trajectory that will bring it into $SECTOR2$ within the next few mizuras. No jump signatures have been detected at this time and it is believed the vessel is working on thrust vectoring only. All combat craft in $SECTOR2$ please remain on high alert. All non essential craft, please evacuate with immediate effect. </t>
 <t id="2030101">The battle with the Kha'ak in $SECTOR1$, while not yet over, has progressed to an even more deadly phase. It appears that several craft are now setting course for $SECTOR2$. While many of these craft are damaged, they are still to be classed as a high-level threat by all vessels in the target sector. We ask all civilian craft to evacuate immediately. Do NOT use the jumpgate connecting to $SECTOR1$. Neither $GOVERNMENT1$ Patrols or military units will be able to guarantee your safety. </t>
 <t id="2030102">Despite a large number of Kha'ak vessels having been destroyed, the threat posed by the swarm has not been reduced. Having engaged with $SECTOR1$ Patrols and military craft, the Kha'ak are now vectoring at full thrust for $SECTOR2$. Combat craft have been scrambled from trade stations, with defence forces preparing for the second phase of what may well turn out to be a very bloody battle. For the sake of our own, we hope the war that now rages on two fronts comes to a swift conclusion. </t>

 <t id="10200">"I can't believe this is happening, I had a good job there, some place that at least offered me some stability. Now? Now I don't know what I'll do," said one dejected worker who had just arrived from station transit.</t>
 <t id="10201">"It's crazy, one minute the station's there, the next it's not. I'm just glad I wasn't there when this all happened." said one slightly bemused character we caught munching on a bofu-burger in the local trade station's canteen.</t>
 <t id="10202">A station manager situated in the same sector offered us a short comment, still clearly concerned with the unfolding situation. "I don't know what to say, - it's not good that things like this happen, not in this age, where we're supposed to have conquered so much that is out there."</t>
 <t id="10203">One worker, evidently still upset by the whole scenario, offered us these words, "there was no warning, nothing untoward that would have said to us, your days here are numbered. This is what frightens us the most, that we didn't know, and that something like this could happen again, anywhere."</t>
 <t id="10204">"It's terrible. I had friends on that station, they were all doing so well. But now, now all I have are memories." - words spoken with great pain by a nearby station worker who is still coming to terms with the loss of such nearby neighbours.</t>
 <t id="10205">When questioned by our reporter, one worried onlooker ventured a few words of disbelief. "It's crazy! I mean how could such a thing be allowed to happen? It's not like we come here to live on the edge, - I thought this sector was safe!"</t>
 <t id="10206">"I don't think I would have expected something like this to happen in our sector, - I thought we had the best of everything here! Apparently not." These words from yet another disgruntled worker, now looking for an alternate means of employment.</t>
 <t id="10207">"All this time, and I never knew. It makes me wonder how close we are to other things that do us no good." These words from a concerned station worker who chose to share with us her concerns for the future.</t>
 <t id="10208">We managed to grab a few words from a Senator handling affairs for the sector before he boarded a shuttle for the planet surface. "It's frightening to know that this happened right under the noses of sector authority. I mean what were they doing? Playing Triskele blindfolded while smoking space-weed? They should be out there patrolling, not sitting on their asses getting fat on bofu burgers. It's an outrage!"</t>
 <t id="10209">One worker we managed to interview was clearly unhappy at the events, "It would have been nice for us to be kept more informed than we have been. How can we plan our lives with such chaos? And to think that people are still trying to find out what has happened to their loved ones. It's terrible."</t>
 <t id="10210">One worker, struggling to come to terms with recent events, offered us these words, "there isn't much we can do. Life has to go on I guess, but seeing so many lost in such a way does very little for my confidence in this sector. I'm not sure if I'll be here myself next mazura. Maybe it's time to cut my ties and make a new start."</t>
 <t id="10211">"I'm shocked, - it's not something I've really thought about much until now, I mean, what if I'd been there when this had all happened?" These thoughts from the partner of a worker who had recently departed the affected area. "I'm not sure what we'll do now, but wherever we go, we'll be thinking of this, of what happened here. It's difficult not to."</t>
 <t id="10212">"It's like something out of a dream, I never thought that something like this would ever happen here. Not here, amongst the places and people that you've grown up with. I don't know what to say." Little else could be gleaned from this worker who was evidently still in shock from the events that have taken this sector by storm.</t>
 <t id="10213">"It's so sad to see things like this happen. I guess every sector has its fair share of joy and pain, but this is something else altogether. I'd like to think that this is the last time I ever have to witness such an event." These words from a worker who had recently been transferred from the affected area.</t>
 <t id="10214">"I really hope they find out what happened. It's terrible that this happened so close to here. It's the worst I've heard from this sector in a long while." These words from a greatly concerned station manager who was now considering her own future. "How can anyone promise us that such a thing won't happen again?"</t>
 <t id="10215">"It's sad to see things like this happen. I know every sector has good times and bad, but it still makes me wonder why these things always seem to happen here. I know we'll get over this in time, but right now, I'm just trying to make it through the here and now. That's always the toughest part." These words from a worker who was still trying to come to terms with the events that have unfolded here before our eyes.</t>
 <t id="10300">It may be some time before the sector comes to terms with the loss of this station. Until then, we wait and hope. To those who have been affected by these events, we offer our heartfelt thoughts. Further updates will be made throughout the coming mazura.</t>
 <t id="10301">Whether or not we will see the return of $STATION$, or some alternative to the services it once provided, only time will tell.</t>
 <t id="10302">There is little to say whether another venture will replace the station which has been lost, all we know is that time moves on, and with it the fortunes of those around us. Stay tuned to this data stream for more updates.</t>
 <t id="10303">There is very little that we can offer to alleviate the fears of those around us, save that those who have the power to do so, are investigating far and wide to confirm the cause for such sudden and immediate loss.</t>
 <t id="10304">There is no word yet as to whether the sector authority involved plans to replace the station with immediate effect, or allow the area to remain available for freelance venturers to try their hand.</t>
 <t id="10305">There is no word as of yet as to further action being taken by sector authority. It may be some time before we are able to come to the root cause of these happenings.</t>
 <t id="10306">With such events still giving authorities great cause for concern, there is little we can yet offer our readers save for words of comfort and confirmation that everything that can be done, is being done, for those affected.</t>
 <t id="10307">There may yet be further developments in this matter, until then, we can do nothing more than ensure that when the news breaks, we are close enough to bring you events as they unfold.</t>
 <t id="10308">Whether the cause of this event is natural or unnatural, you can be assured that in time the root of the mystery will be unearthed. Until then, we can speculate and ponder, however none of this will take the place of the cold hard facts we will of course provide you as they come through to us. Patch into this data stream for further updates.</t>

 <t id="10310">Few have been able to do more than speculate as to the outcome of this situation. Given the number of people affected, this sector may well have worse to come in terms of the backlash from such an event. We will of course keep you updated as to the current situation.</t>
 <t id="10311">Despite our best efforts, there has been little official word from sector authority save that everything possible is being done to ensure that those affected are kept informed. We will of course bring you the news as it breaks. Stay tuned to this data-stream to receive the latest from our regular newscast team.</t>
 <t id="10312">Our reporters await further word from sector authority, as to when such information will come, no one knows. Until then, we will remain on alert and offer our sympathies to those affected by the situation that is still far from over at this time.</t>
 <t id="10313">We have little else to add to this story at this time, save that perhaps there may be further confirmation from sector authority as to what action will be taken in light of the number of people who have been affected by this event.

 <t id="3010014">A Stones Throw From Oblivion</t>
 <t id="3010015">End Of An Era For Station Owner</t>
 <t id="3010100">Following what may possibly be one of the worst environmental failures in $GOVERNMENT1$ history, there has been little choice but to completely dismantle and dispose of the $STATION$ within $SECTOR$. With immense quantities of production material having leaked into both the station air supply and life support systems, there has been no alternative but to initiate a full removal procedure. It is unclear whether the materials involved were hazardous enough to warrant such action, but authorities chose not to take any chances, fearing that loss of life at any level would result in the sector suffering further loss of confidence and trade opportunities.</t>
 <t id="3010101">After several jazuras, the owners of the $STATION$ operating in $SECTOR$ finally decided to take desperate measures in an attempt to locate several missing Argnu, who, in their search for somewhat better pastures, broke free and decided to roam far beyond the confines of the cargo bay they were held within. Working on sound alone, and the faint smell of waste gas emanating from the small but vociferous herd, station workers managed to locate all Argnu. Damage to station plating and structure was so widespread that the only course of action was a complete rebuild.</t>
 <t id="3010102">After many successful generations of trade in $SECTOR$, the inevitable stench of greed has wrapped its hands around the owners of the $STATION$. The ruthless Teladi tycoon Oluminogos Yasullios Moiyen III has once again forced another station to shut down and cease trading, all in the name of ever greater profits and fewer competitors. With a monetary offer said to range in the tens of millions, the owners of the station succumbed to the temptation of a quick profit and sold out. Within mizuras, station tugs and deconstructors arrived in-sector to engage in the process of dismantling.</t>
 <t id="3010103">Fears are growing for the safety of a family in $SECTOR$ who apparently left their $STATION$ after dismissing all employees and halting production. More disturbing is that the factory was placed in self-destruct mode, - or worse, was deliberately destroyed by other forces. Authorities continue to question those in their employment, as well as reviewing all data transmissions that were initiated within the last few jazuras. Given that this is now one of many occurrences of the same type of incident, it appears that there is something more sinister afoot than just the decision to cut losses and leave.</t>
 <t id="3010104">In what appears to have been a freak event, a freighter in $SECTOR$ engaging its jump drive before clearing docking moorings at the $STATION$ has dragged the entire station into an unknown plane of existence. Whether the station is intact or destroyed, no one has yet been able to confirm anything other than the following ; on entry into the target sector, the freighter brought with it several pieces of now detached station hull plating. This in itself is a cause for great concern. Given that literally hundreds if not thousands of ships dock and undock with stations while trading, it seems strange that such an event has not occurred before. Rumours persist that the ship involved was carrying a drive that had either not been serviced correctly, or was running firmware that was unable to prevent jump sequences from initiating when in close proximity to a station.</t>
 <t id="3010105">In a move that many have seen as potentially one of the most despicable acts in recent commercial history, a station owner within $SECTOR$ has quite literally stolen the ground from under his partners feet. While there is still no confirmation on who the individual is, what we do know is that sometime within the last few mazuras, in the shadow of darkness, an entire $STATION$ was shut down, dismantled and relocated to a sector as of yet unknown. All workers were dismissed without any word of remuneration or settlement.</t>
 <t id="3010106">The failure of both primary and back-up gravity generators has led to the loss and removal of yet another station within $SECTOR$. With both station owners and the manufacturers of the generators now wrapped in a bitter legal dispute over compensation for lost profits, the $STATION$ has been removed for further inspection at the manufacturers request. Under normal circumstances, it is extremely rare for both sets of generators to simultaneously fail, which begs the question, was this sabotage in the hope of legal remuneration? Or something far more sinister?</t>
 <t id="3010107">Following the discovery of an illicit Pleasure Complex operation running within the very confines of a $STATION$, sector authorities at $SECTOR$ have chosen to take firm action by shutting down the facility completely, with a complete deconstruct and removal being initiated at the owners expense. Hoping that this may cause other owners with such plans to think again, we have yet to see if further operations of this kind are discovered. It strikes us as being somewhat strange that workers did not notice the presence of scantily clad pleasure-borgs smothered in nostrop oil. Whether they were in collusion with those involved, or simply getting free or cut-price services, we have no idea.</t>
 <t id="3010108">The sector of $SECTOR$ woke up today to a strange sight, - the apparent disappearance of yet another station, this time a $STATION$. The cause of the disappearance is still being reviewed, rumours are spreading of everything from a massive cloaking device, to theft by the Yaki who have recently been specialising in mobile stations.</t>
 <t id="3010109">Amongst the many genuine efforts to replace many of the ageing factories in $SECTOR$ with newer models, another station has been dismantled in an apparent confidence trick. A team of individuals recently boarded the $STATION$ disguised as sector management, then notified station owners that preparation for a new structure was being made to replace their station over the coming mazura. Shortly after, the station was shut down at speed and dismantled, with little in terms of replacement save for some space debris and leftover canisters. While genuine constructors are still wary of discussing all their details in public, it is clear that any new station replacement will be preceded with official paperwork and incorporate all the latest facilities known and loved by traders and workers alike. Should you receive anything less, contact sector authority immediately and lock down your facilities until they arrive.</t>
 <t id="3010110">The fear of contracting Argon flu from migrant traders has done more than just affect profit margins. Due to the severity of this jazura's strain, more and more workers have chosen to work elsewhere. The end result of these choices has been that yet another station has been shut down and dismantled, in this case a $STATION$. Despite assurances of immunisation and protection from those passing through $SECTOR$, few have been swayed by such words.</t>
 <t id="3010111">A set of minor repairs that should have taken no more than a few mizuras of down-time for the $STATION$ in $SECTOR$ have resulted in the complete destruction of the facility. The station owner, as of yet at large, decided in his infinite wisdom, that undertaking the repairs himself, instead of hiring certified technicians, was the best thing to do. Shortly after this decision, workers were seen fleeing the station in shuttles as the entire facility lost power and life support. Soon after this, structural integrity was lost, leaving sector authorities with no choice but to take the station apart before it fell to pieces.</t>
 <t id="3010112">In what may be the most astounding news this mazura, sector authorities have uncovered Yaki operations within the heart of a $STATION$ in $SECTOR$. Military forces cordoned off the area while the station was shut down and removed for further investigations at a more secure area. Hoping to gain further insight into the workings of this clandestine pirate faction, little was being left to chance here. Those employed at the station are currently undergoing interrogation to clarify whether workers were aware that some of their shift-mates were in fact Yaki.</t>
 <t id="3010113">A station owners final wish was marked today with his demise. In what appears to be a growing trend, the owner chose to be interred upon his $STATION$, which was then placed on an intercept course with the nearest sun. Now out of sight and scan range, it is expected that the station will burn up within the suns gravitational range in the next mazura. All workers have been transferred to other facilities within $SECTOR$ until further employment can be found. While few station managers consider this to be a wise use of resources, they are still reticent to argue with their employers final wishes, which very rarely can be overturned.</t>
 <t id="3010114">Juvenile delinquents are being blamed for the destruction of a $STATION$ in $SECTOR$. It is still unclear as to whether they all perished along with others in this tragedy. Deciding that throwing rocks into the gravity wells would be fun, they were somewhat surprised when the rocks gained momentum and made a sling-shot at incredible velocity back out into the inner hull of the station. Thinking this was little more than another level of excitement to be had in their lethal game of physics, they then proceeded to source the largest rock available from nearby ore freighters. According to witnesses who were in the process of departing when the incident occurred, several of the youths pushed the immense rock to the edge of the gantry. Seconds later, with the station hull pierced, few heard their screams as one of the group was sucked out into the void, while the others struggled to keep their blood from boiling in the sudden vacuum. Station safety protocols not being correctly set for internal breach damage, failed to initiate lockdown, leaving the entire station without air supply. The facility has been removed and is the focus of what is now a crime scene.</t>
 <t id="3010115">After a lifetimes worth of trading in $SECTOR$, the owner of $STATION$ has chosen to close shop for the final time this mazura. With no apparent heirs, and no confirmed buyers, the station has been dismantled and sold to scrap-merchants for recycling. Our owner looked somewhat forlorn as he departed what had been his home for so long, "so many memories have been had here, I've seen times or war, times of peace, the good and bad of all races, but in the end, all we have are our memories." We could respond with little more than sympathy to such honesty.</t>

 <t id="0">X³: Reunion Playable Demo</t>
 <t id="101">Welcome to the playable demo of X³: Reunion.</t>
 <t id="102">This intro will give you some initial information about the game.</t>
 <t id="103">More information will be shown as you get close to points of interest.</t>
 <t id="104">You can abort these tutorials at any time by pressing ESC.</t>
 <t id="105">This is the ship you're currently sitting in.</t>
 <t id="106">It's a small fighter which is not very strong but relatively fast.</t>
 <t id="107">You can transfer to one of your other ships.</t>
 <t id="108">You transfer by either ejecting and entering the other ship or by using a teleport device.</t>
 <t id="109">This is your heavy fighter.</t>
 <t id="110">It's an M3 class ship which is more powerful than your current ship.</t>
 <t id="111">Here you can see your transporter.</t>
 <t id="112">It's a TS class ship. You can use it to transport cargo, but it's not heavily armed.</t>
 <t id="113">You also already own a fully operational station complex.</t>
 <t id="114">Fly there to get further information.</t>
 <t id="115">There are docks and stations where you can buy and sell all kinds of wares.</t>
 <t id="116">You can dock there and use the menu to communicate with the station.</t>
 <t id="117">This demo universe contains 5 sectors. You are currently in Argon Prime.</t>
 <t id="118">To enter another sector just fly through a jump gate.</t>
 <t id="119">You should visit other sectors that are currently unknown to you. Start with the sector to the North.</t>
 <t id="120">In the X³ universe you will sometimes find pirates and smugglers.</t>
 <t id="121">You can buy a police license and a freight scanner which allow you to scan ships.</t>
 <t id="122">If you discover and destroy a pirate, you'll get a reward.</t>
 <t id="123">These are the Kha'ak. They are a hostile race details of which are mostly unknown.</t>
 <t id="124">To make this demo more interesting, a group of Kha'ak will attack you at regular time intervals.</t>
 <t id="125">The attack waves will increase in their strength.</t>
 <t id="126">Use the peaceful time between the attack waves to earn money.</t>
 <t id="127">You will need to buy better equipment in order to be able to defeat more waves.</t>
 <t id="128">Now have fun with the game - and good luck!</t>
 <t id="129">Use the peaceful time between the attack waves to earn money.</t>

If you like, try the demo again - maybe you'll defeat even more attack waves.</t>
 <t id="510">You are now approaching your complex. It produces microchips that can be sold.</t>
 <t id="511">Other traders will dock here and buy them.</t>
 <t id="512">You can also take them and sell them yourself, or even command your transporter to sell them automatically.</t>
 <t id="513">To do so, give your transporter the command to sell wares and select microchips.</t>
 <t id="514">Your complex will need silicon wafers to continue producing. They can be found in asteroids.</t>
 <t id="515">Use your transporter to mine the asteroids or build a silicon mine on an asteroid.</t>
 <t id="516">A mine can be bought in a shipyard, but you have to hire a TL like a Mammoth or a Orca to transport your station.</t>
 <t id="517">A mine can be bought in a shipyard, but you have to hire a TL like a mammoth to transport your station.</t>
 <t id="520">You have just entered Kingdom End.</t>
 <t id="521">It's one of five sectors available in the demo.</t>
 <t id="522">The sector belongs to a race called the Boron.</t>
 <t id="523">In X³ there are several different races. They have some unique technology such as different ships.</t>
 <t id="524">Fly to a dock to check out the offered wares there or have a look at the different ships the Boron use.</t>
 <t id="530">You are now sitting in your transporter.</t>
 <t id="531">It has a large cargo space but weak weapons.</t>
 <t id="532">You can use it to transport cargo from one station to another.</t>
 <t id="533">It also has all the equipment needed for mobile mining.</t>
 <t id="534">You can use the mining laser to shoot an asteroid to smaller pieces.</t>
 <t id="535">Those pieces can also be crushed with normal lasers.</t>
 <t id="536">Once the pieces are small enough, you can open your cargo bay and collect them by flying towards them.</t>
 <t id="537">You can give your ships orders. The transporter could be used to sell wares for you.</t>
 <t id="538">That only works if you're not sitting in it, and you have to give the ship a homebase first.</t>
 <t id="539">You can set the homebase in the command menu of your transporter while not sitting in it.</t>
 <t id="540">There are several stations in each sector.</t>
 <t id="541">The main sectors contain special stations with a huge variety of wares that you can buy.</t>
 <t id="542">This is a shipyard. You can buy ships and stations here. While it's easy to buy ships, you'll need a TL to buy a station.</t>
 <t id="543">You can search for a Mammoth or an Orca and contact its captain, then hire him and tell him to dock at the shipyard.</t>
 <t id="544">That way you can buy a station and let the TL take it to its destination for you.</t>
 <t id="545">Here you can see an equipment dock. That's the place to go if you need better lasers or shields.</t>
 <t id="546">You can also buy different upgrades for your ships there.</t>
 <t id="547">The trading station trades a lot of different goods like food or minerals.</t>
 <t id="548">If you ever look for something or want to sell anything, try it there.</t>
 <t id="550">You have just entered your fighter.</t>
 <t id="551">As already mentioned, it's much stronger than your scout.</t>
 <t id="552">It can still be upgraded with one more shield and more weapons.</t>
 <t id="553">A good choice would be to buy a mass driver with corresponding ammunition.</t>
 <t id="554">To afford that you need to earn money or you could sell your scout.</t>
 <t id="555">To do so, order it to dock at the shipyard. Then trade with the station using the menu or dock there.</t>
 <t id="556">You could also keep it and let it protect you. Then it will fight the attacking Kha'ak.</t>
 <t id="557">Use the protect me command if you want to.</t>
 <t id="901">Your small fighter</t>
 <t id="902">Your heavy fighter</t>
 <t id="903">Your transporter</t>
 <t id="904">Your station complex</t>

 <t id="0">BBS Quest - 'Blackmail'</t>
 <t id="1">[author]$AUTHOR$[/author][justify]Pilot, this is $AUTHOR$, I oversee all operations aboard this station. I also protect those who choose to use our services. No doubt you are aware that Pirate bases are not the safest of places.  Your enemies are perhaps closer than you realise. I can offer you protection from any potential threat or damage to you or your ship; for a small fee, naturally. You would be wise to take me up on this offer.[/justify]\n\n[center][select value='moreinfo']How much is my safety going to cost me?[/select][/center]</t>
 <t id="2">[author]$AUTHOR$[/author][justify]The cost of $CREDITS$ Credits will allow me to station a couple of AI Defence Borgs close to your ship, along with a member of my protectorate who will ensure all is well. Surely you can see the value in this now?[/justify]\n\n[center][select value='accept']That seems like a fair deal. But cross me and you're as good as dead.[/select]\n[select value='decline']I think I'll take my chances, no deal. Take your protection racket elsewhere.[/select][/center]</t>
 <t id="3">[author]$AUTHOR$[/author][justify]Such a shame that your funds are below what we would require. As such, we cannot guarantee your protection during your stay with us. But of course, our offer remains. Return to me should you find the money to secure your safety.[/justify]</t>
 <t id="4">[author]$AUTHOR$[/author][justify]Excellent! I see you have some sense in that strange skull of yours. I have engaged both AI Defence Borgs and a protectorate officer close to your ship. They will remain there for as long as you are docked. A pleasure doing business with you, come back should you require our services again.[/justify]</t>
 <t id="5">[author]$AUTHOR$[/author][justify]Such a shame that you have chosen to decline my offer. A bad choice if I may say. You might want to stay close to your ship, we wouldn't want anything bad to happen to it, would we? Oh, and we appear to be experiencing power surges at this time, I would stay away from the dark.. it would be terrible if you were to be injured, or worse..[/justify]</t>
 <t id="6">[author]$AUTHOR$[/author][justify]Pilot, your ship is already protected, but we can, of course, raise the level of security for our more discerning customers. You can never be too well protected from the foul scum who lurk within our dark station.[/justify]</t>

 <t id="1001">Wield the developing power of your fledgling fleet and face the X Universe head on. You are well equipped for your journey, but there may be advantages to doing it the hard way...</t>
 <t id="1002">Conquer a harsh and unforgiving universe with the pure power of your will. Struggles will present themselves at every turn. Even your enemies loathe you with an unusual intensity.</t>
 <t id="1003">You have the tools and the passion to discover the riches of the myriad worlds around you. Follow your lifelong dreams and uncover the mysteries of the X Universe.</t>
 <t id="1004">Leverage your business skills to master and dominate the trade lanes. Amass the ultimate fortune and spread the fingers of your empire to the far reaches of the stars.</t>
 <t id="1005">Your combat skills are formidable, but your bank account is not. Your capacity for destruction is your only tool for clawing your way above the rest of the world's petty scum.</t>
 <t id="1006">Tolerated by few, accepted by none. Only you will ever know whether your criminal branding is justly deserved, and only you can redeem yourself... if you even care to bother trying.</t>
 <t id="1007">Seize your rare and precious opportunity to earn a name for yourself. Stand apart from your millions of fellow Argon citizens, and etch your name in the stone of history.</t>
 <t id="1008">Not being royalty makes it exceedingly difficult to command any respect at all. Prove your noble worth as a lar to the kingdom... and to the rest of the universe while you're at it.</t>
 <t id="1009">Honour the glorious commands of Xaar and take your place among the loyal saints. Shine as a beacon of holiness and purity to the benighted aliens of the universe.</t>
 <t id="1010">Claim glory for your downtrodden family on the field of battle. Wield the weapons, cunning, and strength of a true warrior, and vanquish any foe who stands in your path.</t>
 <t id="1011">It's all about the profits. Make the big buckzoids and leave your mark on the business world for generations to come.</t>
 <t id="1012">Fulfil your duties to bring truth and peace to the broken, ruined souls of the universe. Spread light, honesty, justice, and unity... or forsake those teachings for a darker path.</t>
 <t id="1013">Crush the insolent and unworthy realm of inferior beings that so thoughtlessly invaded your world and destroyed your home. Let nothing stand untouched!</t>

<page id="302600" title="Gametips" descr="Ingame tips for the player that are shown once an action is performed for the first time." voice="no">
 <t id="1">Welcome to the Interactive Assistance System. This feature of your ship computer will automatically present information about common tasks you may wish to perform, based on your current location and situation. You can access all information in one location by choosing Options, then All Tips from your ship menu. Data will be streamed to your onboard computer should you encounter species or items requiring further information essential to your survival. If at any time you wish to disable this data-stream, you may do so by changing from Beginner to Veteran in the Options menu of your ship interface.</t>
 <t id="2">You have acquired your first weapon system. While in combat, you can configure up to four weapons profiles to control which weapons are loaded and active. Next to each weapon slot indicator on your HUD is a selector which you can use to activate or deactivate the given weapon slot in each weapons profile. You can switch profiles at any time by selecting the profile number icon on the HUD, or via a hotkey. Due to the complexity of installing weapons systems, you will only be able to change the types of weapons loaded on your ship when you are docked, at which time you can install and remove weapons via the Weapons menu.</t>
 <t id="3">You can observe other ships and stations in your sector via the monitor window in the upper right corner of your display. The monitor in the upper left will display a view of your current target. You can monitor your target by opening the Identification menu \(press [VK_IDENTIFY]\) and selecting the Monitor option.</t>
 <t id="4">Your ship's data interface can be controlled with the mouse. To activate the mouse cursor, press [VK_MOUSETOGGLE]. You can fully customise your interface controls by selecting the Controls item from the Options menu.</t>
 <t id="5">Most common functions of your ship interface can be accessed directly with the quick-access icon bar on the right side of your display. Select the up arrow to open the icon bar. You can also access many common functions with configurable hotkeys. These keys can be customised by selecting the Controls item from the Options menu.</t>
 <t id="6">Around the edges of your display you will see targeting icons for all contacts your scanners have picked up. Select these icons to target the object and receive additional options for interacting with the object. Your HUD will automatically display indicators of the target's status and current position.</t>
 <t id="7">Different ships are capable of deploying different missiles. While all ships can carry missiles as cargo \(provided they have sufficient space\), many missile systems are only supported by certain ships. You can review your ship's missile capabilities specification in the Weapons screen as well as the Ship Details screen. When docked, your ship's information is accessible through the Personal area of the main menu. While flying in space, this information is directly available through the Current Ship area.</t>
 <t id="8">This ship has multiple weapons turrets. You can manually control these turrets by pressing [VK_COCKPITVIEW] to cycle through them, or configure them to automatically respond to threats via the Orders screen for your ship.</t>
 <t id="9">The dregs of the underworld, criminal fringe, and lawless scum of the universe gather in these pirate bases to trade in illegal goods and arrange for various shady activities. Regardless of your reasons for being here, your very presence is likely to earn you a death mark from someone. Dealing with the pirate clans can be immensely profitable, but don't be surprised to find a bomb planted in your cargo bay.</t>
 <t id="11">You are in close proximity to a trade ship. With a special Freight Scanner upgrade, you can check the contents of other ships and their cargo bays. Note that while you can scan ships freely, most governments require that you have a special Police License to use a Freight Scanner. Scanning without a license can have serious consequences.</t>
 <t id="12">With appropriate policing licenses, you can actively engage in combat with confirmed enemies, as well as intercept and neutralise smugglers without casting any undue suspicion on yourself in the process. Many local governments offer nominal bounties for terminating invaders and criminals, so skilled vigilantes can earn a substantial living by holding security licenses. The license also allows you to use a Freight Scanner device to locate criminals and smugglers.</t>
 <t id="13">You have locked on to a civilian ship. These vessels comprise the bulk of the space-faring population, and are the lifeblood of the economy. Civilian transports are primarily menial in nature, and pose no particular threat.</t>
 <t id="14">Sector police vessels primarily work to maintain the peace within their space, as well as ensure ships in transit through the sector are not carrying illegal cargo. Enemies and criminals are likely to be dealt with very harshly by the local security forces.</t>
 <t id="15">You can eject from your ship at any time with the Ejection hotkey \([VK_EJECT]\). You can also use this hotkey to re-enter a ship you own while you are in your spacesuit. An option to enter your own ships will be available in the Identification menu when you are close enough to the ship.</t>
 <t id="16">This ship is currently not claimed by any owner. To take possession of this ship, eject from your ship and approach it in your spacesuit. When you are close enough to the ship, an option to enter it will become available in the Identification menu.</t>
 <t id="17">You have received a warning from your Ship A.I. At your current position, your ship computer is unable to lock down a safe trajectory along which to fly. Please take manual control and move your ship to a location that will allow vector recalculations to be completed successfully.</t>
 <t id="18">You will fly a race now. Fly to the marked start position and wait there for the start. After the start, follow the targeted waypoint objects until you reach the finish line first. You will lose race if you leave the sector or if you are last and more than 30 seconds behind the racer in front of you. </t>
 <t id="19">Saya has used a Jump Scanner to find out where Marani jumped to. The coordinates have been uploaded to your boardcomputer. When you open your jumpdrive menu with [VK_JUMPDRIVE], you will have the option to choose these coordinates directly or select another location from the galaxy map.</t>
 <t id="20">Once you have hired a TL class ship and loaded your station on board, you will need to give it further instructions. To do this, go to the station menu and select the ship from the list of landed ships. You can then give the Captain your orders.</t>
 <t id="21">The laser target computer enables you to target your enemy more effectively. It provides two features to help you in combat. It allows your ship computer to automatically adjust the laser direction by a few degrees to improve accuracy, and it also provides you with a lead firing indicator to help you aim in the right direction. Press [VK_LASERTARGETMODE] or click the icon to the left of the laser groups to toggle between the available target modes.</t>
 <t id="22">You are able to mine precious metals and minerals from asteroids, once they have been broken up into small enough pieces. After the asteroid has been fragmented, - either by mining laser or Hornet missile, you will then need to break it up further using laser weaponry. Eventually you will be able to source rocks that are small enough to be refined by your Ore Collector, which you must have installed. You will notice them by their differing colour. Be aware that these small rocks will vaporise if fired upon. Open your freight bay and collect the rock as you would do standard cargo canisters to initiate pick-up. Please be aware that there is currently only one miner ship available that is able to handle a front-mounted mobile drilling system. It is up to you to source locations for this vessel's purchase or acquisition.</t>
 <t id="101">If you wish to buy a station at this shipyard, you will need to engage the services of a TL class ship. This vessel will dock with the shipyard on your behalf and load all material required for installation. You will be able to issue commands to the TL after your purchase, allowing you to specify which sector and in what physical location your station is to be unloaded. While hired, the TL will make a charge for every sector you travel through.</t>
 <t id="102">Shipyards are the prime location for purchasing, repairing, and selling ships. Ships of many different classes and variants are produced in shipyards throughout the universe. Smaller ships such as the M5 class provide fast but lightly armed scout ships. TS freighters are excellent platforms for carrying trade cargoes. Many ships are available in variants that improve specific aspects of the ship's performance, such as shielding power or cargo capacity. Heavily customized ships are rare, however, and thus very valuable.</t>
 <t id="103">You have targeted another object in your local vicinity. You can identify this target by pressing [VK_IDENTIFY]. The Target Identification menu will allow you to access additional details about your target and provides options for interacting with your target.</t>
 <t id="104">Once you have engaged the services of a TL class vessel, you can either dock at the shipyard and interact with the station's trade interface directly, or you can trade remotely providing you have the necessary trade software. Either way, you will need to wait until the TL has docked and confirmed it has authorisation to trade on your behalf before you can begin to make purchases. </t>
 <t id="105">Now that you have deployed your first station, it is time for you to choose various options that will affect both your profit, as well as the level of business and turn-over you achieve. Setting your selling price high might scare off potential buyers, but if it is too low you may lose money on your products. Similarly, be sure to buy your resources for reasonable prices to optimise your profit margin. Here you can also control how many sectors away ships assigned to this station will fly to buy and sell goods, via the Jumps setting. Experiment with these parameters and be prepared to adjust them in response to changes in the local economy.</t>
 <t id="106">Any ships that you own or purchase can be assigned to your stations to buy and sell goods. To assign a ship to your station, open the Orders menu for the ship, and set the ship's Home Base to this station. You will then be able to issue Trade orders to the ship. All worker ships will follow the settings you have assigned to your station, including price and maximum travel range.</t>
 <t id="107">You now are in possession of multiple ships. While you are manually piloting one of your ships, you can use your others to work for you by issuing them orders. Target one of your own ships and select Orders from the Identification menu. You can change the ship you are currently flying by docking at a station, ejecting from your ship and spacewalking, or with a special teleporter device that is available at certain locations.</t>
 <t id="108">Equipment docks specialise in upgrades for ships. Command Software upgrades offer access to additional orders that can be issued to ships. Many different devices are available which can extend the usefulness of your ships. Additionally, you can upgrade the main engines and steering systems of your ships to improve speed and handling. Special subspace compression upgrades also allow you to expand the cargo capacity of certain ships.</t>
 <t id="109">Scanners operate on a variety of power levels, from close-range to long-range sector-wide overviews. More powerful scanners can be installed on your ship to provide a better view of the sector, provided that your ship is capable of handling the larger scanner equipment.</t>
 <t id="110">The Universe Map provides a visual display of the territory that has been recorded in your ship's computer database. It also provides you with the ability to monitor remote locations in real-time. Information from any ships, stations, or monitoring satellites you own in a sector will automatically be uploaded to your ship's computer on a regular basis, and displayed via the Universe Map.</t>
 <t id="111">Your ship has the ability to dock and interact with various stations. You can allow your AI subsystems to do the work for you with an auto dock \(see your operations manual for the interface commands\) or you can request docking rights manually by opening a communications channel to the station. Use the docking lights and ship speed indicators as a guide on your approach.</t>
 <t id="112">You will usually find gates situated at the North, East, West, and South points of a sector. Not all sectors will make use of all four jump points. Layout is dependent on your location in the universe. Be aware that on occasion you will encounter gates that are neither marked nor freely known of within the local sector traffic. An alternative means of travel is the jumpdrive device, for which you will need the minimum of an M4 class vessel and an energy source. It is commonly available from the Goner Temple in Cloudbase South West. </t>
 <t id="113">Freight comes in a variety of standardised container sizes, known by their TC class: Small, Medium, Large and Extra Large. Different ships are outfitted to handle different sized containers. You can view the maximum container size handled by your ship and the total cargo capacity in your Ship Details screen. When docked, your ship's information is accessible through the Personal area of the main menu. While flying in space, this information is directly available through the Current Ship area.</t>
 <t id="114">This area is your ship's command and control interface. Here you can issue and manage orders for your ships and stations. Purchasing software upgrades and installing other technology may update the command software with additional orders and options.</t>
 <t id="115">Ore Belt is a particularly dense asteroid field. Here many entrepreneurs have earned a fortune through mining. There are a variety of ways you can engage in mining, from purchasing an ore or silicon mining facility at a shipyard, to using mobile drilling apparatus mounted on specially built ships. At close range, a mining rig will pummel an asteroid until it shatters, allowing you to scoop up the debris of ore or silicon into your cargo bay. Special mineral scanning upgrades are also available which can help locate the richest and most profitable deposits.</t>
 <t id="116">You have entered a sector that is claimed by the Xenon. The Xenon have been the scourge and mortal enemy of the known universe since time immemorial. With no single intelligence, they work purely on directives issued from a distributed AI of unknown origin. They do not communicate openly and will not listen to reason. Open combat with the Xenon is usually considered unwise.</t>
 <t id="117">Your ship scanners have reported the presence of a hostile vessel nearby. The targeting system can be placed into threat-prioritisation mode by pressing [VK_NEXTENEMY]. In this mode, the targeting computer will automatically select an enemy target. Should the target lock be lost for any reason, a new target will automatically be selected.</t>
 <t id="118">A message has been transmitted to you and received by your ship computer. You can access the message by opening the Pilot menu and selecting the icon for Incoming Message.</t>
 <t id="119">Once docked at a station, you have the option to browse through and access data within the online BBS, or Bulletin Board System. Here you will find news, messages, and job opportunities. You may also come across information vendors offering you maps and other technical data. </t>
 <t id="120">You have purchased a weapon that requires a specific form of ammunition. It does not feed directly from your ship's energy banks, but instead draws from a supplemental ammunition supply stored in your ship's weapons bay. You can purchase ammunition for such weaponry from various suppliers, although it is likely to be cheapest directly from the manufacturer.</t>
 <t id="121">Here you can save and restore your status as you see fit. Saving is available free of charge when docked at any station. In addition, private insurance firms offer salvage policies that will allow you to save your status at any point you wish. Should you encounter any situation that leads to the destruction of your ship or property, and should your body be medically viable for restoration, you will be returned to the status of your last salvage point.</t>
 <t id="122">You have locked on to a cargo container. Containers hold a variety of items and are the standard method by which goods are stored for transit. Dependent on the size of the container and your available cargo space, you may be able to pick this container up by opening your cargo bay \(press [VK_OPENBAYDOOR]\) and guiding your ship to the location of the container. Be warned that while your cargo bay is open, your shields are down and your ship will be vulnerable.</t>
 <t id="123">Should you accidentally damage or destroy a ship to which you had no hostile intentions, you can contact local sector police or military units to declare the incident, - allowing you to be exonerated. Contacting a capital-class military vessel will allow all ships owned by that vessel in the sector to have their friend or foe status reset. This does not include any ships that are docked within the vessel itself. Smaller ships will of course also accept your amnesty. </t>

 <t id="25001">You may repair any ships you own at a shipyard or wharf, select your ship from the trade menu and press the right arrow to repair the hull. The repairs will be marked at a percentage level allowing you to make partial repairs if you do not have enough credits to initiate a complete repair cycle. You may also repair your ships at your own HQ, assuming you have one.</t>
 <t id="25002">There are several means of equipping large ships. Familiarize yourself with the operation of the Transporter Device offered at the Goner Temple. You can dock the ship at a Shipyard and after escaping from the initial trade screen, will see a secondary trade screen that offers ship equipment. Or you can drop the equipment out of the cargo bay of one ship and pick it up in another just like any other cargo.</t>
 <t id="25003">Shipyards sells a combination of factories and combat or transportation craft. Wharfs only deal in the repair and sale of ships.</t>
 <t id="25004">You can buy police licenses from trading stations across the universe. Some special stations may also sell them. As to why you need them, well you don't actually need to buy yourself one except for the receipt of bounty payments from helping to defend a sector against pirates and other enemies. Obviously this license only extends as far as the race that owns the sector. Pirate sectors are lawless and dangerous places. There is no-one there who would honour a police licence. Best not advertise you hold one to all and sundry when you are in a Pirate sector!</t>
 <t id="25005">These may well be the Markus Spacefly. They are known to live in space and are attracted to the energy fields created by ships and weapons. For many jazuras the Split have used them as fuel.</t>
 <t id="25006">Jumpdrives are specialised pieces of equipment that require a minimum of an M4 class ship, and energy cells to power the devices core. Once installed, ensure you have enough energy onboard for the journey you wish to take, - bear in mind that different sized ships will require different amounts of energy to make the jump. Once you have enough energy, target the sector you wish to jump to. You will see all sectors within range with your current energy load as being highlighted. Once you have selected the sector, you will be able to choose which gate you wish to arrive at. Having selected the gate, your ship will automatically initiate the countdown procedure and engage your jumpdrive once the core is fully powered.</t>
 <t id="25007">Transporter Devices work only within a limited range. Ideally your target ship should be within 4km of your vessel. It must also be in your control. Once within range, open your ships console up and select the target, then select Transporter Device. This will beam you from your own cockpit, to the cockpit of the target ship. Bear in mind that if the target ship does not have a transporter device installed, you will either need to take a walk in space, or have both ships dock at a station in order for you to return to your original vessel.</t>
 <t id="25008">M6 vessels are somewhat unique in that there are a limited number of stations with which they can dock, for example, equipment docks, shipyards and wharfs, as well as your Player HQ, should you have one.</t>
 <t id="25009">This button does all sorts, depending on what you have targeted. Selecting a station and pressing it will have your ship automatically dock at that station, selecting a ship and pressing it will have you follow that ship, and selecting a jumpgate and pressing it will send you through that jumpgate. It should also be noted that you will be able to engage your SETA whilst in autopilot unless you are scanned, which greatly speeds up going through jump gates and docking.</t>
 <t id="25010">They are goods outlawed by some races such as spaceflies, spacefuel, spaceweed, swamp plant, slaves and squash mines. They have been outlawed for a number of reasons, from war conventions to preservation of endangered species.</t>
 <t id="25011">Slaves are outlawed everywhere. Other goods depend on the race. Look through your sector map for any factories that are set at some distance from the main sector coordinates. Some of these may produce goods considered illegal to other races.</t>
 <t id="25012">If you are scanned and do not eject the goods in time, Sector Authority will take action. First they will ask you to eject the illegal cargo. If you refuse they will fire on your ship and call for additional support.</t>
 <t id="25013">You can a) mine ore or silicon with a Mobile Drilling System or b) you can just build a mine on an asteroid.</t>
 <t id="25014">Apart from a Mineral Scanner and a ship that has the ability to use a Mobile Drilling System, you need an Ore Collector, XL cargo capacity and of course the Mobile Drilling System itself.</t>
 <t id="25015">The Teladi Vulture and Paranid Demeter can both be equipped with the Drilling System and both ships can carry XL cargo. You may also be able to use a TL for this purpose, however due to their size, manoeuvres may understandably be more complicated.</t>
 <t id="25016">The Ore Collector can be bought at Teladi and Paranid equipment docks. The Mobile Drilling System can be bought at all Argon, Paranid and Teladi Equipment Docks.</t>
 <t id="25017">You need to fly within a few hundred metres of an asteroid and shoot it with the Mobile Drilling System until it breaks apart. Then you can collect the fragments with the ship, providing a Ore collector is installed on it.</t>
 <t id="25018">Ore, silicon and nividium.</t>
 <t id="25019">Ore is needed to produce weapons, shields and Quantum Tubes amongst other things.</t>
 <t id="25020">Silicon is required for the production of missiles, shields, crystals and satellites. Generally all high tech wares that have some level of artificial intelligence built into them will require some amount of silicon for their manufacture.</t>
 <t id="25021">A very small number of Teladi Trading Stations stock it and a small number Paranid Space Jewelleries use it for Majaglit production. You may find other stations that deal with the protection of endangered species also require nividium for purposes which we cannot disclose here.</t>
 <t id="25022">Minerals can only be found on asteroids. The only way to find out what an asteroid contains is to scan it with a Mineral Scanner. The Mineral Scanner also determines the asteroid's yield.</t>
 <t id="25023">Asteroids can be found in many sectors. The sector with a high number of asteroids in Argon territory is Ore Belt. There are of course other sectors where asteroids are equally prolific.</t>
 <t id="25024">The Mineral Scanner can be bought in all Argon Equipment Docks.</t>
 <t id="25026">The methods used to extract ore and silicon differ markedly. For best results make sure you place an ore mine on an asteroid containing ore, and of course a silicon mine on an asteroid containing silicon.</t>
 <t id="25027">Unfortunately no, we do not currently have the technology to mine Nividium directly. But you can use the Mobile Drilling System, or a Hornet missile.</t>
 <t id="25029">The idea is simple: Buy Low, Sell High. Search for something that is being sold at a lower price than normal and buy it. Then go and find a station that is offering a better price than you paid. The greater the difference, the greater the profit! It will help you if you learn how much the different wares cost, and how cheap they can be, as well as how expensive.</t>
 <t id="25030">Trade the wares you can carry, and extend your ship's cargo hold and add Engine Tunings as you go - but be careful! Don't buy a Cargo Hold Extension with the Credits you need for your next load of cargo! Later on you can buy a bigger ship and trade in your old one to pay for your next load of cargo.</t>
 <t id="25031">I recommend you visit the Teladi and buy their Best Buys Locator and Best Selling Price Locator upgrades. These will access the trade menu list of all the stations in your current sector and tell you which ones offer the best deals.</t>
 <t id="25032">Place a Navigation Relay Satellite in any promising sector. Then, if you want to check the prices in that sector, bring up the Navsat's Info screen and activate the Best Buys and Best Selling Price Locators. They will interface with the Navsat's comms system and report the best deals.</t>
 <t id="25033">The best way to find good trade runs is to go out there and explore. Find one sector where stations are competing to sell the same ware, and another sector where stations are fighting to buy it. That, is a very good trade run. And if you make profit on the way back, then you have a very good run!</t>
 <t id="25034">It is indeed! Trading Stations buy and sell wares at guaranteed prices which can be very helpful. But even better are the Merchants who visit Trading Stations. They have some of the best trading deals you can find; and will buy, sell, or exchange wares. But be careful, not all of them are honest!</t>
 <t id="25035">Many traders make their money by using Sector Traders and Galaxy Traders. You provide a fully equipped transport ship, capital, and the right trading software, and the pilot will trade for you. Give them time, and they can become extremely experienced.</t>
 <t id="25036">A TS-class ship with a fully-extended cargo hold and the Trade Command Software Mark 3, which you can buy from the Teladi. I advise you to fit it with good shields as it is an expensive investment that you don't want to lose too easily.</t>
 <t id="25037">You need a Sector Trader ship with a pilot that has an experience level of at least 8. Galaxy Traders live a dangerous life, so look after them - they demand a ship with at least 25MJ of shielding, plus Fight Command Software Mark 1 and Mark 2. It is also a good idea to provide a Jump Drive so they can jump out of trouble should enemies attack!</t>
 <t id="25038">Not at all! But it may save you money in the long run as the pilots almost always buy one for themselves when they reach Experience Level 12, and that costs more than if you provide it in the first place.</t>
 <t id="25039">You can order any ship you own to go to any station you wish to trade with. But to use it to trade remotely, you must fit your ship with the Trading System Extension. Then, once your other ship has arrived at its destination you can access its Information screen and Trade with the station it is docked at.</t>
 <t id="25040">Inside and outside, you get a comm. list. The people who are available and willing to talk appear on this list. Just click their name and they'll answer if they want to. You do have to be close to stations if you're not docked though.</t>
 <t id="25042">Check your mission log. It's all written in there.</t>
 <t id="25043">Building an HQ is an important decision. You will only have one, and the location you put it in will be the center of all your action in the future. What is best really depends on your plans for the future. Are you more interested in the strategic benefits that the HQ can bring or is the repair capability the most important? Wherever you put it make sure you will be able to protect it in the future!</t>
 <t id="25044">Well many recommend the use of plasma weapons whenever possible. Sure they get you a lot of bang for the buck, but personally I would recommend looking into some alternatives too. As a pilot not bound to the restrictions of the Argon armed forces, you could for example have a closer look at wide area lasers.  They are perfect to use against Kha'ak clusters when they've just jumped in. You shoot at the whole damn cluster at once and don't have to hit every single one of them. Be careful however when you have wingmen as this weapon can easily lead to friendly fire, or unfriendly fire!  A perfect combination of course is to afford both: Plasma as big as you can get and a wide area weapon both together</t>
 <t id="25045">Check the markets. The times are rough and in times of war and chaos, markets can often offer interesting chances. I have heard of saboteurs ruining factories and driving the prices up for their own good, not that someone like you would do that.</t>
 <t id="25046">Its impossible to tell you one particular factory that will make you the most money. It depends on how much money you have to spend and what the current market situation is. Of course you have to look at the market and the local specialities. For a start it isn't wrong to go for the cheaper factory types. Run a powerplant or maybe a mine before you go up to the bigger stations. You should decide early if you want to continue to run factories as a single money maker or maybe want to build a bigger installation where goods of one of your own stations are the resources for another. In the latter case the local specialities become less important as you can be completely independent from the rest of the market. For such installations also consider combining factories into a complex. The recently developed linking tubes are a perfect way to save money to spend on ships and transportation costs.</t>
 <t id="25047">A nice way to make money can be to collect the wreckage left after battles. Sadly there are many large scale battles these days. If you dare to stay around there, you can often pick up containers and salvage everything from cheap goods to expensive missiles or even shields. You'll also find containers and wreckage in remote parts of inner sectors and hidden in the outer sectors.</t>
 <t id="25048">You can always make some extra money if you look out for containers or other debris floating in the outer regions of sectors. Often what looks like junk at first can be worth quite a lot. Certainly worth the time picking it up. Your best chances are to look where others don't go try in asteroid fields or inside dangerous nebulae for example.</t>
 <t id="25049">Well it depends if you use a mining laser or if you plan to build a full blown mine there. In either case you should get a mineral scanner and search for those asteroids with a high Ore or Silicon content. Building a mine is a large investment but gets you more money in the long run, while mining with a mining laser can be fun and gets you a lot of money quickly. However, this normally requires two ships. One equipped with the mining laser and one with large transport capacity that can hold Ore.</t>

 <t id="732">The unholy one clearly chooses to fly like a blinded heretic. I ask that you cease this madness.</t>

 <t id="740">The Priest Xaar sends word of trading pricing requirements. Please transmit your data to us.</t>
 <t id="741">Bounty is mine! The unholy one has chosen unwisely.</t>
 <t id="742">Honour and strength have deserted us. All I require are credits. Nothing else matters.</t>
 <t id="745">Core temperature is critical. If our ship is consumed, then by the light, I shall see you in hell!</t>

 <t id="701">Of great importance is this request. Even your assistance would be useful, lowerlife.</t>
 <t id="702">The Paranid have great pleasure in seeing our contract complete. May you take pleasure in the superior nature of our gift to you.</t>
 <t id="703">Perhaps we must look elsewhere, for you are clearly inferior to our needs.</t>
 <t id="710">There may be salvation for you yet. The Paranid thank you for your assistance.</t>
 <t id="711">We shall assist as much as we can. Patience pilot, for all things will come in time, even death.</t>
 <t id="712">The Priest offers you his compliments, but not his protection. You are far from home, unholy one.</t>
 <t id="713">Enemies approach. The Priest Xaar senses danger!</t>
 <t id="714">Fade into the darkness, for we are in danger of being detected. Evasion is yours to take.</t>
 <t id="715">I feel as if drunk you are. Your ship shows little control.</t>
 <t id="716">Paranid have no argument with you. Desist or lose your salvation!</t>
 <t id="717">We see little of any concern. Our journey shall pass with strength and honour.</t>
 <t id="718">We choose not to be defiled by the fire of enemy ships on this journey. May those around us assist in thwarting this unholy attack.</t>
 <t id="719">Perhaps this jazura is a good time to die. Perhaps the unholy will save me.</t>
 <t id="720">There is much we have to say, but none to you pilot! Leave us, unholy one!</t>
 <t id="721">The Paranid have little time to share with one such as you. Our superiority is unquestioned. Our future, however, remains uncertain.</t>
 <t id="722">By the light of the Priest Xaar, welcome my friend.</t>
 <t id="723">The priest Xaar bids you farewell.</t>
 <t id="724">We appreciate your contact.</t>
 <t id="725">Look beyond the eyes you hold, for great treasure lies in unfamiliar paths.</t>
 <t id="726">Truly a sign of our sacred origin, look ahead and acknowledge our superiority!</t>
 <t id="730">The unholy one chooses to interfere with our travels? Foolish are you!</t>
 <t id="731">Your speed bores me. I have seen Argnu run faster than your ship.</t>
 <t id="732">I feel as if my very limbs are about to tear asunder. Priest Xaar, save me from this senseless speed!</t>
 <t id="733">This place does not please the Priest Xaar. Errors we have made in our journey.</t>
 <t id="740">I feel as if prices I do require. The time for trade has come upon us. Transmit now.</t>
 <t id="741">You choose to take what is mine. You choose wrong. Think again, pilot!</t>
 <t id="742">The Paranid would request a few spare credits from the unholy one. Redeem your defiled soul with payment.</t>
 <t id="745">My displeasure grows. We should not have taken her out. She can barely lock in docking coordinates.</t>
 <t id="746">Your ship, while damaged, shows signs of honour and courage. We salute you.</t>
 <t id="750">(confused, tripping out on drugs)My eyes... from three to two have they gone! My world, it spins. May the Priest Xaar forgive me!</t>

 <t id="701">Our need for profits grows. We ask you to assist and gain many credits in doing so.</t>
 <t id="702">We thank you pilot. Your efforts have resulted in much profits. A commission worthy of one such as you is on its way.</t>
 <t id="703">Much profit have we lost. Your failure is unacceptable. Our contract is over!</t>
 <t id="710">You have saved our lives, and our profits. We thank you.</t>
 <t id="711">Our assistance will save much profits... we will join you, pilot.</t>
 <t id="712">There may be more danger than profits where you travel. Be wary, pilot.</t>
 <t id="713">Both profit and life stands in danger! Our enemies approach!</t>
 <t id="714">Our profit lies in clear view! We must hide! Go now, patrols are inbound!</t>
 <t id="715">Our ship requires greater distance. Adjust your course!</t>
 <t id="716">Stop! (frantic)Stop!! Think of the profits!</t>
 <t id="717">Our profits are safe. The journey ahead remains free of concern.</t>
 <t id="718">Our ship has come under attack. For the greater good of all profit, assist us!</t>
 <t id="719">My profits I will gladly forfeit, please assist! Our ship is failing under fire!</t>
 <t id="720">There is little profit in our annoyance. Your presence is not required.</t>
 <t id="721">Our profits are low, our commerce weak. We have little to be thankful for, pilot.</t>
 <t id="722">Our profits are yours. Salutations!</t>
 <t id="723">May profit be with you. Journey well.</t>
 <t id="724">The Teladi thank you.</t>
 <t id="725">Profits lie in many things. Do not be afraid to widen your commerce.</t>
 <t id="726">Teladi ask you to review your surroundings. There may well be more to life than profits!</t>
 <t id="730">Our profit, as well as our journey, is hindered by your ship. Please adjust your course.</t>
 <t id="731">Your speed troubles us. Engage your thrusters before our profits vanish.</t>
 <t id="732">Greater speed does not always mean greater profit. Your speed must be lowered!</t>
 <t id="733">Teladi know not where they have arrived. Our profit lies elsewhere.</t>
 <t id="740">Teladi request transmission of all profit-lists for goods!</t>
 <t id="741">Profits are ours! Claim we have taken! Your business lies elsewhere!</t>
 <t id="742">Our profits are low, our commerce weak. We request donations to aid our journey... it's an investment!</t>
 <t id="745">Profit is not guaranteed with such a ship as this. Unacceptable!</t>
 <t id="746">The Teladi assume you have been attempting contact with the Xenon, for your ship bears marks of war.</t>
 <t id="750">(slow, hissing much heavier than usual)Profits we will not make today, for today I am... I am... what am I again?</t>

 <t id="703">You show little skill in commerce! How could one such as you fail?</t>
 <t id="710">The Teladi offer their thanks for your actions. May profit shine upon you.</t>
 <t id="711">Your future holds great worth. We shall assist.</t>
 <t id="712">The Teladi ask you to reconsider your journey, safer commerce lies elsewhere.</t>
 <t id="713">Commerce must wait, we have enemy ships closing!</t>
 <t id="714">We risk loss of many credits! Engage evasive manoeuvres! Sector patrols are active!</t>
 <t id="715">You are no pilot! You are endangering our profit!</t>
 <t id="716">Hold fire! Do not endanger our profit!</t>

 <t id="720">I do not wish to trade, to talk, or to listen. You will find no profit with me, pilot!</t>
 <t id="721">The Teladi hope that business improves for us. May profit go with you, pilot.</t>

 <t id="723">Teladi wish you well. Goodbye.</t>
 <t id="724">May profit go with you, pilot.</t>

 <t id="726">Much has happened here, much change - we request your attention, pilot!</t>
 <t id="730">The Teladi have much to teach you of navigation. Your ship requires a course correction!</t>
 <t id="731">We have little left to lose and much to gain should you choose to accelerate.</t>
 <t id="732">There may be greater commerce elsewhere, but we may not survive to profit from it, should you maintain this speed.</t>
 <t id="733">Our journey towards greater profits has ended abruptly. Perhaps this course is incorrect.</t>
 <t id="740">Please transmit all current price data. Profits await us all!</t>
 <t id="741">This one is not for you! This is marked for Teladi Corporations!</t>
 <t id="742">We have little else other than a dream of great fortune. Please help us, we ask for no more than a few of your valuable credits!</t>
 <t id="745">Perhaps commerce must wait until our ship is repaired. Most upsetting.</t>

<page id="301810" title="Beginner Tutorial 0" descr="Quick Menu introduction (spoken by Instructor)" voice="yes">
 <t id="1">Welcome to the Argon Federation Space Academy, my name is Uri Seldom and I will be here to guide you through the key features of the interface for your ship computer. You may quit this tutorial at any time by pressing Shift-Q on your ships data interface.</t>
 <t id="2">You are currently sitting in an M5 Argon Discoverer. This is a small scout-class vessel, however the menu structure will remain the same regardless of which ship you pilot. This standardisation was introduced to prevent confusion not only for the different pilots but different races amongst the known universe.</t>
 <t id="3">Now, let's start off by showing you how to access you primary ship menu.</t>
 <t id="4">Press the Enter key on your ships Data Interface.</t>
 <t id="5">Good. You will now see an Information Panel appear, labelled Main Menu, along which you will see five icons, Pilot, Current Ship, Navigation, Target and Options.</t>
 <t id="6">You will notice that the icon for Navigation is slowly pulsing. This indicates that Navigation is currently your selected option. You can use your right or left arrow keys, or activate your ships Mobile Online Universal Sector Engagement device, or M.O.U.S.E to select the Navigation icon now.</t>
 <t id="7">Excellent, you have selected the Navigation Menu, which has now been opened to show you two additional options, Universe Map and Sector Map. The Universe Map will provide you with a clear idea of where you are, in relation to those sectors you have visited, or purchased maps for. This will often help you plan out flight routes or trading strategies.</t>
 <t id="8">Select the Universe Map option now. You will immediately see your sector represented by a circle enclosed by a square. Pressing Enter again will show you the same view as the Sector Map, allowing you to view all scanned ships, stations and other objects in range.</t>
 <t id="9">Pressing Esc on your ship data interface will bring you back one level, pressing it again will do the same. Once you have pressed Esc twice you will now be at the main menu. You can also use the down arrow to go back to the previous menu, this serves as an alternative to the Esc key.</t>
 <t id="10">You can access all other menus using the same commands, either with your M.O.U.S.E or by ship data interface.</t>
 <t id="11">On the main menu you will see four other menu options: Pilot, Current Ship, Target and Options. Opening the Pilot menu will enable to access all data and records that reference your personal status, from the time you have been flying, to how many credits you have, as well as the property you own. You will also be able to initiate an emergency eject from this menu using the Eject option. \(This will disengage your ships automatic safety mechanisms and allow you to break through the cockpit. Please ensure you are wearing your spacesuit before engaging Eject.\)</t>
 <t id="12">Now let's look at the Current Ship Menu, pressing Enter or using your M.O.U.S.E to select it with one left click will allow you to view all data for your current ship. This includes information such as your ship equipment, any cargo it is carrying, its weaponry and shield specification, as well as what class or capacity of cargo you are able to carry.</t>
 <t id="13">The submenu for your Current Ship will offer you four further options. Details will provide you with an in-depth look at your ship specification. The Weapons menu will show you which lasers and missiles are currently loaded into your mounts. The Orders menu will give you the option to command your ship using a variety of options and choices. And finally the freight menu will give you a rundown of what your ship is currently holding. On this menu you will also have the option to choose to eject any items you no longer wish to carry. To do so simply use the arrow keys to highlight the item, then select eject, and then specify how many of the item you wish to eject using either your numeric pad, or the arrow keys.</t>
 <t id="14">Now press ESC and then choose 'Target' from the Main Menu.</t>
 <t id="15">The Target menu offers you the chance to view detailed information about the ship or object you have locked on using your ships heads-up display system. This will include ship class, name, shields and weaponry, as well as other information that you are privileged to access.</t>
 <t id="16">Finally, the "Options" menu will allow you to configure the behaviour of the universe you are in. These items are explained in detail in your Ship Computer interface manual. Under the game menu you will also be able to access options to engage salvage insurance to save or load prior points in your progress. You will also be able to pause your current status, as well as depart from the X universe.</t>
 <t id="17">You have now seen the basic concepts and levels of information that you can obtain from your ships menu interface. We hope you will have an enjoyable flight.</t>
</page>

<page id="301811" title="Beginner Tutorial 1" descr="Beginner Tutorial 1: Basic Controls (spoken by Instructor)" voice="yes">
 <t id="100">You can look up ALL keys for various types of controllers in your printed manual or the most common ones from the HELP menu which opens up by pressing the H key. -- To familiarize yourself with the controls, a number of Kessler Rings have been activated. Your task is to pass all rings. Rings that you have not passed yet are marked with a green light. -- You control the ship steering with the "turn ship" and "roll ship"-keys as well as a wide set of (ADDED)"strafe" and(/ADDED) "speed control" keys. Look them up in the manual now and learn how to manoeuvre your ship through the rings.</t>
 <t id="102">You see the ship computer's main menu. Now leave the menu by pressing the "back" or the "Close menu" key.</t>
 <t id="130">Very well done. You have successfully collected a container which is now in your ship's freight bay. Now it's time for a space walk. -- A new ship has arrived near your location and waits to be boarded by you. Move in closer to the new ship, then leave your cockpit via "eject pilot from ship" in the ship menu.</t>
</page>

<page id="301812" title="Beginner Tutorial 2" descr="Beginner Tutorial 2 (spoken by Instructor)" voice="yes">
 <t id="0">Welcome back to the Argon federation space academy simulator. My name is Uri Seldom. In this simulation level we will concentrate on menu usage. I will also explain how to trade with stations and to have some fun you will be allowed to destroy a couple of ships using missiles. You can again quit this session at any time.</t>
 <t id="3">Very good! You are now docked to the station.</t>
 <t id="15">From the "Freight Bay"-menu you get an overview of wares you have on board and what upgrades are currently installed in the ship. Goods can be ejected here. -- You have some unnecessary plankton loaded. Eject all of it now by first selecting it and then selecting the amount with the "menu selection left/right" keys. -- Then confirm your selection with the "select" key. Please select the appropriate menu option now.</t>
 <t id="21">When the targeting system has locked onto the station open the Sector Map again.</t>
 <t id="25">Ok, the station's docking mechanism is ready for your ship to land. Now approach very carefully, otherwise you will collide with the station.</t>
 <t id="61">Good! This time your defenceless opponent is an M3-class ship. When you open the info menu for the target you see the ships' actual shield and hull strength. - Note that a ship's hull can only be damaged once the shield level reaches zero. -- However any damage you inflict on a ship's hull is permanent and would require a repair service offered by all shipyards. - Damage done to the shield of a ship on the other hand is only temporary. It regains its power after a short time. -- The Dragonfly missile has a destruction power a little more than the current shield and strength of this ship. So, if you launch this missile towards the ship, it will not just reduce the shield to zero but even harm the ship's hull already. To blow up the ship you need to destroy the ship hull completely!</t>

<page id="301813" title="Basic Tutorial 3" descr="texts for Basic Tutorial 3 (spoken by Instructor)" voice="yes">
 <t id="5">Good. You can now observe what's going on behind your ship in monitor nr. 1. -- But a monitor is not just a nice display. You can even take over the control of any monitor with just one button. Press the "activate next monitor"-key now.</t>
 <t id="6">With this key you can cycle through the connected monitors. (CUT) Once the monitor is active your controls are all mapped to this view. -- In an active monitor, you can now again cycle through the available views as well. Press the "next cockpit"-key one time now to switch to main-cockpit view in monitor 1.</t>
 <t id="27">OK. The TL has now docked here. Dock at the station and bring up the stations menu.</t>

<page id="301831" title="Advanced Tutorial 1" descr="Advanced Tutorial1: Two Factories" voice="yes">
 <t id="50">Good work - the transporter will now move on - heading to the Solar Power Plant. We'll care about it later on. As you own a second transporter, use it to get Ore automatically. -- Command "Transporter 2 of Forge" to "Buy ware..." and then choose "Ore" and as destination factory the "Ore Mine Alpha". -- This will make the ship fly to the specified station to get the resource but this time it will fly out only once.</t>
 <t id="52">Very well done! The transporter is on its way to get Ore for the Forge. -- Now we have to wait until "Transporter 1 of Forge" has landed at the Solar Power Plant. Meanwhile you could watch the transporter in a monitor...</t>
 <t id="60">"Transporter 1 of Forge" has landed at the Power Plant! Now you will find the menu-item "trade with station" in its ship menu allowing you to load the needed Energy Cells into the ship. Buy 600 Energy Cells right now.</t>

 <t id="2252">BoGas factories artificially manufacture BoGas, which is only found in its natural state on the Boron home planet. These factories are simple affairs containing chemical mixtures in huge vats where the gas is formed naturally.(||) Large piping systems then drain the gas into decanting areas where it is put into large sealed cylinders for ease of transport. Traditionally these factories were constructed from metal made from ore supplied by the Argon but throughout the last seventy years the Boron have been refurbishing and re-equipping their BoGas factories using Teladianium.</t>
 <t id="2284">BoFu meals are known to be very nutritious and healthy. The Boron love them and it is said that their pilots can live on just a nugget of BoFu for almost a week.(||) BoFu is grown in special BoFu Chemical Labs from Plankton and other secret ingredients. Even though the Boron are famous among other races for their delicious Stott spices, the taste of BoFu is no joy to anybody but them.</t>
 <t id="2354">Chelts are marine animals that once roamed the seas and oceans on the Split home planet that the Split killed for meat, oil and their skins, which they processed to create a tough leather-like material. However for many years Chelts were over-hunted and almost brought to extinction. Nowadays Chelts are grown in space Chelt Aquariums and are later sold to Split food factories.</t>
 <t id="2603">(General description for all High Energy Plasma Throwers)The radiation is so dangerous that the weapon had to go through many years of research and development until it could be placed on the market. This was worked around by adding a radiation sink into the weapon's main design. Purging the weapon of all excess radiation between shots.</t>
 <t id="2629">This laser is used in larger weapon systems and by many small to medium fighters.</t>
 <t id="2649">A weapon found in some medium and large fighters.</t>
 <t id="2699">A deadly weapon found on frigates, destroyers and carriers.</t>

 <t id="2742">{17,2748} {17,2710} (General description for shields and BIG shields)</t>
 <t id="2743">200 MJ Shield (speak Megajoule)</t>
 <t id="2749">The 200 MJ(speak Megajoule) Shield is a medium protection shield. Typically used by corvettes and some large transport ships.</t>
 <t id="3112">The Colossus is the main carrier of the Argon military.  As new technologies have been developed in recent years, the design has undergone several major overhauls.  With a large hangar capacity for fighters, strong shielding and numerous turret batteries, the Colossus is one of the most powerful vessels in the Argon fleet.  Argon One, the flagship of the Argon fleet, maintains a dominant presence in Argon Prime.</t>
 <t id="3122">Until the building of Argon One, the Titan-class destroyers were the biggest ships in the Argon fleet.  Although heavy and difficult to manoeuvre, in the hands of a capable Argon captain, this ship is a powerful weapon with a noble heritage.  Its predecessors fought and won many major battles in both the Xenon Conflict and the Boron Campaign.  Since then the ship has been regularly updated and redesigned and it remains the heaviest-armed and shielded vessel in the Argon fleet.</t>
 <t id="3142">The Argon Buster was once the pride of the Argon fleet and was instrumental in gaining the Argon victory in the Xenon Conflict. However, during the Boron campaign, it was superseded by the Argon Elite.(||) Over the intervening years the design of the Argon Buster has been modified and new, more powerful engines have been fitted. Now updated, the Buster is again a firm favourite of the Argon Fighter Command.</t>
 <t id="3182">A typical Argon Space station used throughout entire Argon federation territory. Developed by Argon over many years, these space stations provide the highest standards of both comfort and technology.(||) Each station is fitted with bars, restaurants, casinos, holographic cinemas and accommodation. They are fine rest and recreation centres. Each space station is under the jurisdiction of the Argon Federation and is governed by an elected senator. He represents the station in the main Argon Senate. Pilots can expect friendly welcome.</t>
 <t id="3312">The Raptor is the Split carrier ship. It first made an appearance in the war against the Boron when it proved to be effective but vulnerable to attack from beneath. It is believed that, over the intervening years, the Split have redesigned the ship to eliminate this problem.(||) Normally these ships are commanded by high-ranking Split officers related by kin to the ruling family clan. Generally they are even more abrasive and arrogant than the other members of their race.</t>
 <t id="3332">A long-serving and deadly fighter developed by the Split Military. It has been only in recent years that this ship has been made available to the public.(||) The current Split Patriarch has a small fleet of these ships that act as escort ships that accompany the primary destroyer of the fleet. In the hands of an experienced pilot, this ship can survive the darkest of battles, due to the ship's high speed it can avoid most of laser beams and missiles.</t>
 <t id="3342">A forerunner of this ship fought in the Boron Campaign and proved to be a pilot favourite.  Like most other Split ships, this design focuses on high-speed engines and increased weapon power, at the cost of shield strength.  Over the years this ship had been frequently updated and rearmed in order to remain as deadly as possible.</t>
 <t id="3362">This huge Transporter is too large to dock in any space station and carries a number of smaller freighters to load and unload its trading goods.(||) It is believed that this Transporter is an evolutionary form of a much smaller Transporter called the Rhino, which seems to have been phased out over the last hundred years. It is believed that a different Split family clan controls each transporter.</t>
 <t id="3452">This ship was designed to be the main scout craft of the Paranid Fleet; lightly armed, but fast. The Pegasus design is considered a success in its role, and has also been widely adopted for various civilian purposes.  Constantly being updated, this ship dates back to the early period of the Paranid and Split war against the Boron.</t>
 <t id="3612">The Xenon carrier is a slow, yet powerful beast. Armed with numerous turret batteries and with a large number of fighters stored in its large hangar bay, a Xenon J is considered a major threat to any civilized sector it happens to be near.  Some ships are able to escape a direct attack from a J-class ship because of its slow speed but these carriers normally carry numerous faster craft to chase down any fleeing ships.</t>
 <t id="3632">Until recently the L was the most powerful Xenon fighter developed; it is armed with multiple lasers, and powerful shields.(||) These ships are often seen attacking passing ships trying to take shortcuts through their sectors. Like the other Xenon ships, the L has been updated in the last few years.</t>
 <t id="4112">The Centaur was developed by Argon Shipwrights in Omicron Lyrae. It is larger than a fighter or small transporter but is much smaller than a frigate.(||) A corvette-class craft, armed with turrets and strong frontal weapons, the Centaur fills the gap between fighters and capital ships.</t>
 <t id="4132">When the long serving Argon Elite was originally retired, the Argon military was left without an M3 fighter, that was until a group of Shipwrights in Omicron Lyrae put forward plans for a new type of ship. The Nova was born shortly afterwards, and after two years of testing, virtually all of the older Elite class ship had been replaced by this new craft.(||) Capable of holding powerful weaponry and armed with an aft turret, the Nova is bound to serve the Argon military for many years to come.</t>
 <t id="4212">The Boron Hydra is a corvette-class ship, developed originally to give extra protection to convoys of freighters.  The Hydra now sees widespread service both as part of regular sector patrols and as escorts for capital ships.  Although many consider the Boron to be pacifists, this ship has been increasingly upgraded to pose a greater offensive threat to the enemies of the Boron Kingdom.</t>
 <t id="4312">The Dragon is the Split's main corvette, which despite early development problems, has matured into a deadly warship, becoming a firm favourite of Split pilots and many privateers.  It is generally considered to be one of most potent craft in its class.</t>
 <t id="4362">This fast transport ship has been in service for many years now. The ship was originally built for slave transport, to ferry slaves from their point of capture to the factories where they would spend the rest of their days.(||) Now the ship is used to transport personnel from sector to sector. It is armed with adequate weaponry, but its main defence is speed.</t>
 <t id="4412">The Nemesis is a compact but deadly corvette; the ship packs firepower comparable with a carrier. It has powerful shields and can carry Hornet missiles. Its speed compares well with fighters', which makes it a very capable escort ship.</t>
 <t id="4472">The Demeter has been used for some years now, replacing the old Paranid Ganymede model. It has improved on all of its predecessor's systems.(||) This ship was first brought into service to serve only the Paranid Fleet, but later slowly replaced the Ganymede because of its speed to bring the Paranid Economy back to levels of the Argon and Boron.</t>
 <t id="4512">The Osprey has undergone a significant redesign in recent years in response to pilots' complaints about its speed. Originally developed as a heavy corvette with a large cargo capacity, recent updates have sought to redress the balance between size, speed and firepower.</t>
 <t id="4674">Originally developed by the Teladi and Paranid, the PSG has since been improved by the Paranid to be a powerful capital ship weapon, extremely useful for defending against multiple fighter targets. It works by sending out a compressed package, which reacts and expands, creating shockwaves of phased energy.</t>
 <t id="5214">In recent years the Argon Agriculture Council has decided that it is unsafe to use Natural Fertiliser from the Argnu Cattle. This artificial fertiliser created by the AAC contains all the essential elements that plants need for growth, but eliminates the ones that are harmful to other life-forms.</t>
 <t id="6991">Ranger</t>
 <t id="6992">The Goner Ranger is one of few ships known to be in use by the Goners. Due to the peaceful nature of the Goners this ship holds no weaponry. The Ranger is quite fast and is also considered to be a good short-range freighter due to its cargo space. It is also capable of holding shields compatible with some M3 fighters. You will probably see this ship roaming the sectors spreading the word of the Goners and Nathan R.Gunne.</t>
 <t id="7001">Eclipse</t>
 <t id="7002">The Federal Argon Government commissioned Bala Gi Research Inc. to develop a heavy fighter, larger than the current Nova, to fulfil a wider range of roles. The result, the Eclipse, enjoys a larger cargo bay than the Nova, at the expense of some speed and manoeuvrability. The Argon military are glad to welcome this craft into their arsenal.</t>
 <t id="7011">Chimera</t>
 <t id="7012">The Split Chimera was developed by Bala Gi Research Inc. following a successful tender to produce a ship that gave better long-range performance over the Mamba. Split defence experts view the Chimera as a logical step to delivering a heavy fighter with enhanced load-carrying capability and endurance.</t>
 <t id="7021">Medusa</t>
 <t id="7022">The Paranid government, learning that Bala Gi Research Inc. was to develop enhanced heavy fighters for other races, asked the company to investigate new design options for a heavy fighter to provide load-carrying capacity enhancements over the Perseus. The Medusa was the result. This new design fills a number of capability gaps that exist within the Paranid Fleet.</t>
 <t id="7031">LX (speak EL EX)</t>
 <t id="7032">Pilots brave enough to traverse Xenon space in recent months have reported sighting a strange ship, larger than a Xenon L. Defence experts have named it the LX. The ship is assumed to have a larger cargo capacity, while being only marginally less swift and agile.</t>
 <t id="7041">Hyperion</t>
 <t id="7042">Once owned by the Pontifex Maximus Paranidia and sailed under the name 'Trinity', this unique vessel was a prototype for a new M6 class of ship. The contract for the serial production of the ship was cancelled for financial reasons when the Paranid Defence Directorate decided to divert funds to its secret jumpgate project. The ship's awesome capabilities place it between an M6 and an M7-class vessel, its astounding design the ultimate in Paranid innovation.</t>
 <t id="7741">Freight Drone</t>
 <t id="7742">The Freight Drone was designed to partially automate the process of transferring cargo.  The Freight Drone has an advantage over the freight beamer in that its operational range is far greater.</t>
 <t id="7858">This production facility manufactures the 1 GJ shields used by frigates and some other capital ships.</t>

 <t id="8134">{17,8130} {17,8139}</t>
 <t id="8139">Developed from reverse-engineered Boron ion weapon technology, the Ion Shard Railgun fires ionised 'shards' of super-heated plasma, which are then accelerated to high speed using magnets.  This combination can wreak havoc on weapons systems.</t>
 <t id="8141">Matter/Anti-Matter Launcher Forge</t>
 <t id="8142">This production facility manufactures the Matter/Anti-Matter Launcher.</t>
 <t id="8143">Matter/Anti-Matter Launcher</t>
 <t id="8144">{17,8120} {17,8149}</t>
 <t id="8149">The Matter/Anti-Matter Launcher fires a bomb-like projectile which contains a small amount of anti-matter suspended in an energy field.  When the energy field is disrupted by impact or fails after a period of time, the anti-matter mixes with surrounding matter, resulting in a large explosion.  This weapon only fires Matter/Anti-Matter Warheads.</t>

 <t id="8163">Cluster Flak Array</t>
 <t id="8164">{17,2699} {17,8169}(A deadly weapon found on most corvettes, destroyers and carriers)</t>
 <t id="8169">Based on the Teladi-developed Flak Artillery Array, the recently developed Argon Cluster Flak Array makes several compromises in exchange for using a deadly cluster munition, which explodes at its maximum range into multiple smaller projectiles, covering a greater area with devastating shrapnel.</t>
 <t id="8171">Phased Array Laser Cannon Forge</t>
 <t id="8172">This production facility manufactures the Phased Array Laser Cannon.</t>
 <t id="8173">Phased Array Laser Cannon</t>
 <t id="8174">{17,2689} {17,8179}(A deadly weapon found on most corvettes, destroyers and carriers)</t>
 <t id="8179">The Phased Array Laser Cannon uses an array of quickly-positionable mirrors to rapidly concentrate energy into a cohesive laser beam.  The speed with which new targets can be engaged makes this an effective anti-fighter weapon.  This enviable ability comes at the cost of doing less damage than similar beam weapons.</t>
 <t id="8181">Phased Shockwave Generator Forge</t>

 <t id="8213">Ion Cannon</t>
 <t id="8214">{17,2699} {17,8219}(A deadly weapon found on most corvettes, destroyers and carriers)</t>
 <t id="8219">Upscaling IPG technology and taking advantage of the massive energy available to capital ships, the Ion Cannon is the pinnacle of Boron ion weaponry.  A huge amount of ion energy is concentrated into a single projectile and can disrupt a target ship's systems, such as engines and weapons, in addition to causing a large reduction in shield energy.</t>
 <t id="8221">Gauss Cannon Forge</t>
 <t id="8222">This production facility manufactures the Gauss Cannon.</t>
 <t id="8223">Gauss Cannon</t>
 <t id="8224">{17,2699} {17,8229}(A deadly weapon found on most corvettes, destroyers and carriers)</t>
 <t id="8229">The Teladi designed this ammo-based low-tech solution in a bid to save money on expensive capital ship energy generators.  The Gauss Cannon uses magnetic coils to accelerate large ionised metallic slugs that, while too big to pass through them, will disrupt enemy shields.  This weapon requires specially-made ammunition in order to fire.</t>
 <t id="8231">Incendiary Bomb Launcher Forge</t>
 <t id="8232">This weapons forge manufactures the Incendiary Bomb Launcher.</t>
 <t id="8233">Incendiary Bomb Launcher</t>
 <t id="8234">{17,2699} {17,8239}(A deadly weapon found on most corvettes, destroyers and carriers)</t>
 <t id="8239">Unable to easily gain possession of high-tech capital ship weapons, pirates designed this as an alternative.  The Incendiary Bomb Launcher essentially produces a large ball of fiery plasma, which it then hurls at the target.</t>
 <t id="8241">Point Singularity Projector Forge</t>
 <t id="8242">This production facility manufactures the Point Singularity Projector.</t>
 <t id="8243">Point Singularity Projector</t>
 <t id="8244">{17,2699} {17,8249}(A deadly weapon found on most corvettes, destroyers and carriers)</t>
 <t id="8249">Recently developed by Terran scientists, the Point Singularity Projector essentially generates a tiny 'jump event' and using a tremendous amount of energy, accelerates it away.  The singularity eventually destabilises, collapses and releases a tremendous amount of energy expanding rapidly outwards, causing massive damage to any nearby ships or stations.</t>
 <t id="8251">Plasma Beam Cannon Forge</t>
 <t id="8252">This weapons forge produces the Plasma Beam Cannon.</t>
 <t id="8253">Plasma Beam Cannon</t>
 <t id="8254">{17,2699} {17,8259}(A deadly weapon found on most corvettes, destroyers and carriers)</t>
 <t id="8259">Originally the beam weapon used in lasertowers, the Plasma Beam Cannon has now been strengthened and adapted to be mounted on capital ships.  While still not as powerful as the heaviest projectile weapons, it fires at the speed of light and thus provides advantages in accuracy and first-strike capabilities.</t>
 <t id="8261">Tri-Beam Cannon Forge</t>
 <t id="8262">This weapons forge manufactures the Tri-Beam Cannon.</t>
 <t id="8263">Tri-Beam Cannon</t>
 <t id="8264">{17,2699} {17,8269}(A deadly weapon found on most corvettes, destroyers and carriers)</t>
 <t id="8269">Faced with the growing difficulty in increasing the lethality of beam weapons, the Paranid developed the Tri-Beam Laser Cannon, which combines three smaller beam weapons into a single larger, deadlier one.</t>
 <t id="8271">Fusion Beam Cannon Forge</t>
 <t id="8272">This weapons forge manufactures the Fusion Beam Cannon.</t>
 <t id="8273">Fusion Beam Cannon</t>
 <t id="8274">{17,2699} {17,8279}(A deadly weapon found on most corvettes, destroyers and carriers)</t>
 <t id="8279">The Fusion Beam Cannon is able to take advantage of the enormously powerful generators on Terran capital ships.  The beam has been known to super-heat target materials to the point of fusion, releasing all the energy associated with that process to cause wider damage.</t>

 <t id="8371">Shadow Missile Construction Facility</t>
 <t id="8372">This production facility manufactures the Shadow Missile.</t>
 <t id="8373">Shadow Missile</t>
 <t id="8374">The Terran equivalent of the Hammer Heavy Torpedo, this missile is specifically designed for salvo fire from capital ships against enemy capital ships.  It is equipped with proximity fusing which means that the warhead will even detonate with near misses.</t>
 <t id="8381">Flail Missile Production Facility</t>
 <t id="8382">This facility produces the Flail Barrage Missile.</t>
 <t id="8383">Flail Barrage Missile</t>
 <t id="8384">Early missile frigate prototypes proved vulnerable to fighter attacks. The Flail missile was therefore designed to counter this, taking advantage of both multiple warheads and advanced target-acquisition technology. Being caught in a Flail barrage is extremely deadly for any nearby enemy fighters.</t>
 <t id="8391">Tomahawk Missile Manufacturing Plant</t>
 <t id="8392">This production facility manufactures the Tomahawk Heavy Missile.</t>
 <t id="8393">Tomahawk Heavy Missile</t>

 <t id="10121">Heavy Centaur</t>
 <t id="10122">Argon naval draughtsmen spent months asking themselves how to improve the Centaur.  With better shields, weapons and engines and absolutely no frills, the new 'Heavy' Centaur is their response.</t>
 <t id="10131">Cerberus</t>
 <t id="10132">The Cerberus was designed in the face of the increasing threat of Xenon and Pirate raiders. It boasts impressive weapons arrays, mainly intended to engage fighters and corvettes, although it can also hold its own against larger threats.</t>
 <t id="10141">Minotaur</t>
 <t id="10142">Sporting a large array of launchers, the Minotaur is a swift and powerful ship, excelling in 'hit and run' tactics.</t>
 <t id="10151">Gladiator</t>
 <t id="10152">Roughly twice the size of a Nova, the Gladiator bomber poses a credible threat to hostile capital ships and stations alike.</t>
 <t id="10161">Large Orbital Weapons Platform</t>
 <t id="10162">This Large Orbital Weapons Platform boasts a large number of weapons and heavy shielding, making it the most powerful option available for orbital security of stations and sectors.</t>
 <t id="10171">Fighter Drone MKII</t>
 <t id="10172">The MkII Fighter Drone offers an increase in both manoeuvrability and firepower over the previous version, while also enjoying an extended range of operation.</t>
 <t id="10181">Medium Orbital Weapons Platform</t>
 <t id="10182">The medium-sized Orbital Weapons Platform provides moderate levels of protection to nearby space.  These weapons platforms are ideal for deploying along trade routes to cover maximum space for minimal cost.</t>
 <t id="10191">Magnetar</t>
 <t id="10192">The Argon military transport, Magnetar, was designed to be able to quickly deploy and retrieve a small number of fighters.  This adds considerable flexibility to Argon fleet operations, providing fighter cover wherever it is needed most.</t>
 <t id="10201">Skate</t>
 <t id="10202">The Royal Boron Navy wisely waited to see how Bala Gi's M3 Plus offerings were accepted before developing its own version.  The Skate is the result and is an extremely capable heavy fighter.</t>
 <t id="10211">Heavy Hydra</t>
 <t id="10212">The redeveloped Hydra was the result of a review following the introduction of the frigate class. The 'Heavy' Hydra is a huge improvement over the original design in almost every area.</t>
 <t id="10221">Thresher</t>
 <t id="10222">The realities of the threats that exist urged the Boron Navy to consider a more robust doctrine.  The Thresher heavy frigate is the result - currently one of the most potent warships available.</t>
 <t id="10231">Kraken</t>
 <t id="10232">The Kraken is nearly as large as an Argon Titan; this larger than average missile frigate gives the Royal Boron Navy an excellent heavy strike capability.</t>
 <t id="10241">Marlin</t>
 <t id="10242">The Marlin is the Royal Boron Navy's first foray into the tactical strike arena.  The Marlin is able to approach with speed and deliver a considerable payload on heavily defended targets.</t>
 <t id="10251">Angel</t>
 <t id="10252">A purpose-built transport for the Boron Lar and other members of the royal family and senior dignitaries.  With enhanced defensive capabilities and long-range communications, the Boron royal family can travel in relative security.</t>
 <t id="10261">Pike</t>
 <t id="10262">Adding the Pike to the Royal Boron Navy's inventory was an inspired move.  The Pike's agility, speed and improved weaponry makes it a fine interceptor.</t>
 <t id="10271">Pleco</t>
 <t id="10272">One of the most recent ships to be commissioned from Kingdom End's shipyard, the Pleco military transport offers increased flexibility and capability in convoy protection and post-combat recovery operations.</t>
 <t id="10281">Krait</t>
 <t id="10282">This prototype warship has only been seen a couple of times in test runs in the outskirts of Kingdom End.  Estimated to be between M3 and M6 size, little other information is currently available.</t>
 <t id="10301">Asp</t>
 <t id="10302">The Asp is a highly manoeuvrable medium fighter, which can hold its own against most similar-sized opponents.</t>
 <t id="10311">Heavy Dragon</t>
 <t id="10312">Acknowledging the need to maximise the potential of the Dragon design, Split military designers have reworked it from bow to stern and the result is an even more formidable warship.</t>
 <t id="10321">Tiger</t>
 <t id="10322">The Tiger frigate is a brand new Split design. It is a fearsome vessel designed for only one purpose: the waging of war.</t>
 <t id="10331">Cobra</t>
 <t id="10332">The Cobra missile frigate is an awe-inspiring and potent warship, giving an outstanding heavy strike capability to any fleet.</t>
 <t id="10341">Viper</t>
 <t id="10342">The Split were naturally among the first to develop a specialised bomber capability.  The Viper epitomises the best of Split ship design and combat effectiveness.</t>
 <t id="10351">Boa</t>
 <t id="10352">There are not many transport ships that you'd want to avoid, but the Boa is one of them.  Split designers tried to optimise every aspect of this military transport's design, especially its ability to launch fighters.</t>
 <t id="10401">Theseus</t>
 <t id="10402">The Theseus medium fighter, while slightly slower than the conventional M4, packs a bigger punch in dogfights and enjoys better shielding and enhanced hull plating.</t>
 <t id="10411">Heavy Nemesis</t>
 <t id="10412">This militarised 'Heavy' variant of the Paranid Nemesis is a no-frills, gritty and very potent corvette.  With ramped up performance in almost every aspect of the ship, it is the nemesis of almost every opponent.</t>
 <t id="10421">Deimos</t>
 <t id="10422">The Deimos strikes a good balance of armament, speed and shielding.  This frigate is a good all-rounder, but is particularly effective when escorting task groups.</t>
 <t id="10431">Ares</t>
 <t id="10432">The Ares missile frigate is a fearsome addition to the Paranid Fleet. Boasting a large array of launchers, the Ares packs a powerful punch.</t>
 <t id="10441">Hades</t>
 <t id="10442">The sleek lines of the Hades belie the steel beneath.  The best of Paranid technology make this bomber a class leader.</t>
 <t id="10451">Helios</t>
 <t id="10452">The Paranid Helios military transport, adding the ability to carry fighter protection, ensures the Paranid Navy can respond faster to emerging threats.</t>
 <t id="10501">Kea</t>
 <t id="10502">Though they first turned up their noses at Bala Gi's multi-race rollout of M3 Plus designs, Teladi designers finally admitted that there is a place for this class in their fleet; the Kea is the result.</t>
 <t id="10511">Heavy Osprey</t>
 <t id="10512">In a bid to boost the overall combat capability of its corvette fleet, the Teladi Company ship designers have optimised internal design of the Osprey to maximise its shielding and armament capacity.</t>
 <t id="10521">Shrike</t>
 <t id="10522">In a bid to catch up with other races, the Shrike was the last M7 to be fielded.  Borrowing heavily from previous Teladi capital ship designs, it should not be trifled with.</t>
 <t id="10531">Gannet</t>
 <t id="10532">The Teladi Gannet adds a heavy strike capability to the Teladi Company's fleet, with a considerable array of offensive options.</t>
 <t id="10541">Peregrine</t>
 <t id="10542">Confronted with an ever-rising threat of enemy capital ships, the Peregrine was specifically designed to help eliminate these dangers in the most cost-effective manner possible.</t>
 <t id="10551">Pelican</t>
 <t id="10552">The Pelican was developed primarily for convoy protection, after growing numbers of Teladi Company transports had been lost to hostile action.</t>
 <t id="10561">Kite</t>
 <t id="10562">In an effort to keep up with the other races' combat ship development, the Teladi developed the Kite to provide a quick but more heavily-armed interceptor than the Buzzard.</t>
 <t id="10571">Kestrel</t>
 <t id="10572">A departure from conventional Teladi design, the Kestrel is now arguably the fastest production ship in the known universe.  It may boast phenomenal acceleration but it suffers poor manoeuvrability.</t>
 <t id="10601">Tenjin</t>
 <t id="10602">Seeing some shortcomings in the Susanowa's overall combat capabilities, the Yaki have developed the Tenjin, which trades a little agility for stronger shields and firepower.</t>
 <t id="10611">Blastclaw</t>
 <t id="10612">The product of rare collaboration between two pirate clans, the Blastclaw is a distinctive and destructive ship, which should be kept at a safe distance.</t>
 <t id="10621">Carrack</t>
 <t id="10622">Recent good relations and cooperation between pirate factions led to the construction of the rare Carrack light frigate.  In typical pirate fashion it was built using mainly old or stolen ship parts.</t>
 <t id="10631">Tonbo</t>
 <t id="10632">Seeing the need to provide a quick but strong medium fighter to better protect transports and to bolster raiding parties, the Yaki have developed the Tonbo.</t>
 <t id="10641">Washi</t>
 <t id="10642">Designed as a blockade-running corvette, the Washi has been strengthened in a number of areas, based on extensive combat experience.</t>
 <t id="10651">Chokaro</t>
 <t id="10652">Leading the development of TM-class vessels among non-aligned races, the Yaki use this ship mainly to support their raiding activities and also to protect against counter-attacks.</t>
 <t id="10661">Caravel</t>
 <t id="10662">With its ability to quickly deploy and recover fighters, the advent of the Caravel has added to the aggression and organisation of pirate raiding activity.</t>
 <t id="10671">Fujin</t>
 <t id="10672">The Yaki developed this small, fast and manoeuvrable scout to keep an eye on the outer reaches of their sectors and to accompany raiding parties venturing into other sectors.</t>
 <t id="10701">Vidar</t>
 <t id="10702">The Vidar is a powerful Terran corvette.  Quick, agile and strong, it is a hugely formidable opponent and comes with a health warning for any pilot not on good terms with the Earth authorities.</t>
 <t id="10711">Aegir</t>
 <t id="10712">Although only a recent addition to the counter-AGI effort, the Aegir heavy frigate has already established itself as an essential part of the ATF's order of battle.</t>
 <t id="10721">Tyr</t>
 <t id="10722">The AGI Task Force maintains a considerable number of these heavy battleships, which provide excellent defensive and offensive options for the Earth fleet.</t>
 <t id="10731">Fenrir</t>
 <t id="10732">Not satisfied with the all-round capabilities of the Thor heavy fighter, the AGI Task Force came up with the bigger, stronger and more dangerous Fenrir.</t>
 <t id="10741">Vali</t>
 <t id="10742">Superseding the previous corvette, the Vali's heavier shielding and weaponry mean that when on patrol or escorting a task group, the enemy will maintain a respectful distance.</t>
 <t id="10751">Skirnir</t>
 <t id="10752">The Skirnir is a formidable warship with the capacity to launch a large number of different weapons at installations and capital ships.</t>
 <t id="10761">Odin</t>
 <t id="10762">The AGI Task Force maintains a significant number of these ships.  With the firepower of a destroyer and the capacity to launch fighters, the Odin-class causes even the most resolute invader to think twice.</t>
 <t id="10771">Valhalla</t>
 <t id="10772">The Valhalla is the AGI Task Force's flagship and mobile command centre.  Nothing moves in Terran space without the Valhalla knowing, and nothing strikes more fear into the hearts of Earth's enemies than the possibility of having the Valhalla appear on their doorstep.</t>
 <t id="10801">Baldric</t>
 <t id="10802">The Baldric is the backbone of the USC's logistics support capability, transporting wares, food and components to USC facilities to ensure ongoing operational capability.</t>
 <t id="10811">Scabbard</t>
 <t id="10812">The Scabbard transport is mainly used in the transfer of personnel between USC facilities and ships.</t>
 <t id="10821">Tokyo</t>
 <t id="10822">The Tokyo-class carrier, with its capacious hangars, is the USC's premier force multiplier.</t>
 <t id="10831">Osaka</t>
 <t id="10832">The Osaka-class destroyer boasts considerable firepower and enhances the USC's ability to project power throughout the Solar System and beyond.</t>
 <t id="10841">Scimitar</t>
 <t id="10842">The Scimitar heavy fighter is the mainstay of Earth's tactical defence capability.  This multi-role ship gives the USC an enviable degree of flexibility in mission planning.</t>
 <t id="10851">Cutlass</t>
 <t id="10852">Being larger and slightly slower than conventional heavy fighters, the Cutlass can normally be found escorting capital and large transport ships.</t>
 <t id="10861">Sabre</t>
 <t id="10862">The Sabre is a capable medium fighter that is optimised for interception duties.</t>
 <t id="10871">Rapier</t>
 <t id="10872">The USC's ability to patrol remote areas of the Solar System and to reconnoitre hostile territory is due in no small part to the Rapier's agility and speed.</t>
 <t id="10881">Keris</t>
 <t id="10882">The USC fighter drone was named after a small curled dagger; very apt, with its ability to confound even the most agile ship.</t>
 <t id="10891">Katana</t>
 <t id="10892">The Katana represents the ultimate in USC combat vessel capability.  The Katana-Class corvette is equally at home supporting battlegroups or on long-range patrol.</t>
 <t id="10901">Corvette</t>
 <t id="10902">Paranid long-range reconnaissance pilots recently discovered this ship in a Kha'ak sector.  It was reported to be of M6-class size and configuration.  Little else is known about this warship.</t>
 <t id="11001">Aran</t>
 <t id="11002">With the ability to rescue stranded Goner ships and to more easily gather its own shipbuilding resources, the Aran is a great asset to the Goners.</t>
 <t id="11011">Ozias</t>
 <t id="11012">Since the settlement of Elysium of Light by the Goner, the TL Ozias, a gift from the Federal Argon Government, has been key to Goner installation development.</t>
 <t id="11101">Boreas</t>
 <t id="11102">With some sacrifices of shielding and armament for speed, this OTAS-developed light destroyer can react quickly to developing situations.</t>
 <t id="11111">Eurus</t>
 <t id="11112">The Eurus medium fighter complements heavy fighters in the protection of OTAS facilities, providing a rapid-reaction intercept capability.</t>
 <t id="11121">Venti</t>
 <t id="11122">The Venti heavy fighter can largely be found guarding OTAS Headquarters.  Its powerful armaments make it more than suitable for this task.</t>
 <t id="11131">Notus</t>
 <t id="11132">The Notus heavy fighter has been developed to provide OTAS with a long-range escort and strike-support capability.</t>
 <t id="11141">Solano</t>
 <t id="11142">The Solano is an advanced interceptor, optimised for rapid closure on hostile intruders.  It has the ability to destroy similar-sized ships or hold larger ones until reinforcements arrive.</t>
 <t id="11151">Zephyrus</t>
 <t id="11152">The Zephyrus military transport, with its ability to carry a limited number of fighters,  provides important tactical flexibility to the OTAS fleet.</t>
 <t id="11161">Skiron</t>
 <t id="11162">The Skiron represents a significant step forward in OTAS corvette design, with most areas of its capability having been enhanced compared to previous models.</t>
 <t id="11171">Aquilo</t>
 <t id="11172">The OTAS Aquilo missile frigate is, unsurprisingly, the inspiration for other races' forays into the heavy strike arena.</t>
 <t id="11181">Auster</t>
 <t id="11182">This OTAS-developed bomber provides owners with a pin-point strike capability against both capital ships and installations.</t>
 <t id="11191">Sirokos</t>
 <t id="11192">Specifically designed around boarding and capturing enemy craft, the Sirokos heavy capture frigate is in a class of its own when it comes to seizing ships.</t>
 <t id="11301">Q</t>
 <t id="11302">The Xenon Q, spotted recently by ships transiting Xenon sectors, appears to be a frigate that increases the Xenon ability to react quickly to incursions into their space.</t>
 <t id="11311">PX</t>
 <t id="11312">Recently spotted in incursions from Xenon sectors, this heavily modified variant of the P represents a considerable step forward in Xenon manufacturing capability.</t>
 <t id="12101">Small Orbital Weapons Platform</t>
 <t id="12102">The Argon Small Orbital Weapons Platform provides orbital defence capabilities over and above that provided by the single weapon Lasertower.  It is mostly effective against smaller ships, especially fighters.</t>
 <t id="12801">Yokohama</t>
 <t id="12802">The Yokohama frigate excels at providing stand-off support and protection to a carrier task force.</t>
 <t id="12811">Claymore</t>
 <t id="12812">The Claymore bomber provides the United Space Command with an easily deployable and flexible strike capability.</t>
 <t id="12821">Spitfyre</t>
 <t id="12822">Heavily modified from older Terran fighter designs, the Spitfyre appears to still fulfil the same role as its predecessors.</t>
 <t id="12831">Springblossom</t>
 <t id="12832">The Springblossom class was originally a derivation of the Winterblossom design that was used to first explore the gate network.  This version appears to be modified for other uses besides exploration.</t>
 <t id="12841">#deca (speak dekka)</t>
 <t id="12842">This appears to be one of the huge CPU ships originally dispatched from Earth to terraform planets and has been modified for a defensive role.</t>
 <t id="12851">#deca.cefa (speak dekka keffa)</t>
 <t id="12852">Originally terraforming drones deployed from the #deca CPU ship, these ships appear to have been modified along with #deca to perform a defensive role.</t>
 <t id="12861">Nagoya</t>
 <t id="12862">The Nagoya-class heavy missile frigate represents the pinnacle of USC ship development.  Recently emerging from the Mars shipyards, this type adds a fearsome heavy strike capability to the Earth fleet.</t>
 <t id="12871">Griffon</t>
 <t id="12872">The Griffon is the Federal Argon Navy's attempt to provide a credible anti-fighter capability without endangering pilots.  It can deploy a large number of MkII Fighter Drones quickly and then escape to safety.</t>
 <t id="12881">Tern</t>
 <t id="12882">The Tern is a surprising innovation for the Teladi.  This light frigate has the ability to produce and deploy mines.</t>
 <t id="12891">Troop Training Ship</t>
 <t id="12892">This Troop Training Ship allows military authorities to conduct a wide range of spaceborne military training.</t>
 <t id="12901">Mobile Repair Ship</t>
 <t id="12902">The Mobile Repair Ship is able to meet the repair needs of many civilian and military ships, especially those that have been stranded in more remote areas.  Such repair, however, does come at a premium.</t>
 <t id="12911">Starliner</t>
 <t id="12912">Starliner vessels can provide luxurious interstellar travel to hundreds of people at a time.  Although expensive, they are not exclusive and many of the nouveau riche elect to take cruises on them.</t>
 <t id="12921">Boarding Pod</t>
 <t id="12922">Boarding Pods are designed to transport boarding parties short distances to enemy ships.</t>
 <t id="12931">Panther</t>
 <t id="12932">The Panther is the result of a failed bid by the Family Whi Shipyard to win the contract to mass-produce a new frigate class.  With some modification to install hangar decks, it was eventually pressed into service as a light carrier instead.</t>
 <t id="12941">Agamemnon</t>
 <t id="12942">Regrettably mass-production of the Agamemnon-class fell foul of the same budget diversion which claimed the Hyperion hybrid M6.  This unique prototype was commandeered for use by the Priest Duke and transferred to Duke's Domain.</t>
 <t id="12951">Galleon</t>
 <t id="12952">The Galleon carrier represents many years of secluded development and reverse-engineering by a cooperative of Pirate shipbuilders.  Pirates can now project a fighter capability where it is most needed.</t>
 <t id="12961">Brigantine</t>
 <t id="12962">The worst fears of shipping and trading companies were recently realised when the existence of a pirate destroyer was confirmed.  Military forces have increased their vigilance in the face of this new threat.</t>
 <t id="12971">Ryu</t>
 <t id="12972">As the Yaki seek to expand their sphere of influence, so must their infrastructure increase.  The Ryu is a key part of enabling Yaki station-building and heavy transport activities.</t>
 <t id="12981">Hoshi</t>
 <t id="12982">Hoshi, meaning star, is the Yaki's response to increasing incursions into its space by Argon and Paranid patrols.  Able to jump in, deploy fighters and retire to a safe distance, Hoshi now makes Argon and Paranid mission planners think twice.</t>
 <t id="12991">Akuma</t>
 <t id="12992">The recently-introduced Akuma destroyer, as its name suggests, is considered a demon among the innocent pilots trying to get safely to their destination.  Little is known about the capabilities of this ship.</t>
 <t id="13001">Akurei</t>
 <t id="13002">Needing some smaller capital ships to provide adequate protection for its embryonic battle fleet, the Akurei was one of two types of frigate developed by the Yaki.  Meaning 'Evil Spirit', the Akurei would strike fear into the heart of many pilots.</t>
 <t id="13011">Kariudo</t>
 <t id="13012">Kariudo, the hunter, is a fearsome addition to the Yaki fleet and provides protection and support to the larger Yaki capital ships. (FYI - Kariudo is also apparently slang for a n00b or a pathological liar)</t>
 <t id="13021">Senshi</t>
 <t id="13022">With agents placed in the military forces of other races, the Yaki became aware of the advent of the missile frigate and immediately sought to counter it.  The Senshi boasts an awesome array of launchers and packs a considerable punch.</t>
 <t id="13031">Guardian</t>
 <t id="13032">Approximately the size of a heavy fighter, the Guardian's main purpose appears to be the protection of a Kha'ak Hive.  It is believed to be equipped with powerful Kyon weaponry and a datalink to the Hive, allowing its defence to be efficiently coordinated.</t>
 <t id="13041">Hive Queen</t>
 <t id="13042">Thought to be the very centre of a Kha'ak collective, the Kha'ak Hive is inhabited by the so-called Hive Queen, which coordinates Kha'ak activity throughout the entire collective.</t>
 <t id="13051">Mistral</t>
 <t id="13052">The Mistral freighter provides essential logistical support to the OTAS fleet and all of its activities.</t>
 <t id="13061">Unknown Biological Entity</t>
 <t id="13062">This Unknown Biological Entity is not recognised in the ship's database.</t>
 <t id="13071">Mobile Pirate Base</t>
 <t id="13072">In an effort to evade military and law enforcement forces, pirates use large vessels such as this as a flexible base of operations.</t>
 <t id="13081">Shuri</t>
 <t id="13082">Using the Shuri as a command centre and base of operations, the Yaki are now in a position to project their burgeoning power well beyond their frontiers.</t>
 <t id="13091">Atmospheric Lifter</t>
 <t id="13092">The Atmospheric Lifter is a specially equipped TL-class vessel which is able to efficiently lift heavy freight and infrastructure from a planet's surface to orbital and extra-orbital facilities.</t>
 <t id="13101">Civilian Vessel</t>
 <t id="13102">One of many flexible civilian designs, this ship is neither heavily armed nor well protected.  These types of vessels are used for a variety of purposes throughout the galaxy.</t>
 <t id="13111">Marauder</t>
 <t id="13112">This corvette-sized vessel has recently begun appearing amongst some larger pirate raiding parties.  With the obvious difficulty of acquiring legitimate corvettes for their own ends, pirate groups have miraculously made these vessels space-worthy to the extent that they are actually becoming quite feared by local merchants and police forces.</t>
 <t id="13121">Woden</t>
 <t id="13122">Designed originally as a possible replacement for the AGI Task Force's Odin-class Carrier, the new Woden-class is designed to be even more flexible in its role, causing many to say it is not even a proper carrier.  It was eventually decided that the Woden-class would be produced in small numbers and be deployed in less conventional carrier roles, while the Odin class remains the mainstay carrier of the fleet.</t>
 <t id="13131">McCallum</t>
 <t id="13132">Named after one of the USC pilots who died attempting to salvage the Xenon prototype jumpship, the McCallum is the USC's current flagship and coordinates USC activities with the Solar system and beyond.</t>
 <t id="13141">Astraeus</t>
 <t id="13142">Excelling in perimeter defence and task group escort duties, the Astraeus-class frigate is an essential part of the OTAS fleet.</t>

 <t id="15024">The Patrol Command Software is a standalone version of the patrol commands originally bundled with the Fight Command Software package. This new version features a streamlined interface and works with a larger range of formations and wing configurations.</t>
 <t id="15033">Carrier Command Software (SS_WARE_SW_CARRIER_1)</t>
 <t id="15034">Carrier Command Software was originally developed by the Split for use on their M1-class ships to give Split admirals greater fleet control. This software has been released in collaboration with a group of Teladi merchants to be compatible with some newer ships with limited carrier capabilities.</t>
 <t id="15043">Advanced Firewall Software</t>
 <t id="15044">The Advanced Firewall Software pack can be added to the central computer cores of large ships to protect against remote or direct malicious access attempts.</t>

 <t id="15101">Cargo Bay Shielding Fab</t>
 <t id="15102">Technology designed to protect and mask the contents of ships' cargo bays is developed and manufactured at Cargo Bay Shielding Fabs.</t>
 <t id="15103">Cargo Bay Shielding(illegal)(SS_WARE_?)</t>
 <t id="15104">Much sought after by pirates on the black market, cargo bay shielding was originally devised to mask the emissions of sensitive military cargo and protect the discovery of it from prying scanners.</t>
 <t id="15111">Low-yield Sidearms Fab</t>
 <t id="15112">Low-yield Sidearms Fabs produce a wide variety of sidearms, ranging from phase pistols to plasma blasters.</t>
 <t id="15113">Low-yield Sidearms(illegal)(SS_WARE_ARMS_1)</t>
 <t id="15114">Low-yield Sidearms(illegal), which include phase pistols, stun guns, laser pistols and plasma blasters, are widely used by many law enforcement forces and military organisations.</t>

 <t id="1030109">(Kuiper Belt)Buried amongst the desolate streams of rock that cover this remote mining operation, lie the dreams of many who came here in search of fortune. Both equally crushed, both little more than a cold dark shadow of the lives they had once hoped for.</t>
 <t id="1030111">(Uranus 2)Without feature or feeling, Uranus stands torn between the grip of the inner system and the hopes of those who have made this silent behemoth their home.</t>
 <t id="1030112">(Titan)Within the cold dark seas of Titan, many see the primordial beginnings of a future home alongside that of Earth. Left untouched by terraforming, for now that future remains unblemished.</t>
 <t id="1030117">{19,1030000}</t>
 <t id="1030208">(Oort Cloud)Deemed to be a viable Class IV mining operation by long-range scout vessels en-route to Proxima Centauri, the Oort Cloud remains largely untouched. Halfway between home and distant suns, few willingly choose to settle here. Those who do are often known to succumb to Oort's Curse, a madness with no reason or cure.</t>
 <t id="1030209">(Pluto)In Pluto lie the beginnings of the Kuiper Belt. Once thought of as being one of Sol's home planets, it has long since been orphaned and discarded to the uneasy drift of Kuiper's reign. Central Control for both Kuiper and Oort mining are based here, alongside the Military Base of Operations for the outer zones.</t>
 <t id="1030210">(Neptune)Known by many as Sol's Eye, Neptune's stunning blue shimmer has enticed many to travel further in search of such sights. The cold harsh winds here are sometimes farmed as a viable source of hydrogen.</t>
 <t id="1030211">(Uranus)Without feature or feeling, Uranus stands torn between the grip of the inner system and the hopes of those who have made this silent behemoth their home.</t>
 <t id="1030212">(Saturn)To fly across the rings of Saturn, to know its beauty and splendour, to gaze upon such timeless grace, to do all these things is to finally accept your home amongst the stars. It remains a rite of passage for those wishing to gain true understanding of the journey taken.</t>
 <t id="1030213">(Mercury)Scorched by the fires of eternity, Mercury remains a modern-day Gehenna for those who still believe in such a place. Forsaken by all but the most hardy of voyagers, there are few systems that hold greater torment.</t>
 <t id="1030216">(Saturn 2)To fly across the rings of Saturn, to know its beauty and splendour, to gaze upon such timeless grace, to do all these things is to finally accept your home amongst the stars. It remains a rite of passage for those wishing to gain true understanding of the journey taken.</t>

 <t id="1030218">Discovered by chance in the travels of an almost mythical adventurer, the governments of the individual races were unable to agree on who should administer this system in the future. In order to underline their own requirements, each race hurriedly built their own space stations. Despite the hefty protests of the Patriarch of the Split, the female discoverer was appointed during the transition to oversee sector development. Each government sent their own workers and colonists, transporters and combat ships, even mighty destroyers to keep the peace in this virgin system. It was the desire of the discoverer of this system to name it after a ship, flown by another female pilot whose origins were a once fabled planet, Earth. The sector is now under Terracorp administration.</t>
 <t id="1030220">Although many ships have been sent to survey this sector, few have returned. Once shunned by all the sentient species, last surveillance records show the system was home to a pirate base that the Xenon placed under constant attack. Pirate forces set this base up in search of easy pickings when the Xenon fleet jumped to a nearby sector, only to find the Xenon returned shortly after in greater numbers. With access to the gate blocked, evacuation attempts were deemed futile, leaving them with no option but to hold their position. Their survival in this sector, while unlikely, is still a case for much debate.</t>
 <t id="1030309">(Rhonkar's Might)Bathed in the blood of war-torn nebulae, the Rhonkar Family chose this sector as a point from which to launch further onslaughts against all who opposed them, as well as lick their wounds when such battles fell short. In the outer rim, countless war-dead are offered to the sun in remembrance of their struggle.</t>
 <t id="1030310">Originally discovered and claimed by the Split Patriarch as a hideaway, this sector is now a thriving commercial colony. It is from here that the Split Patriarch ordered his forces to repel the attacks from the rebelling Family Rhonkar. In the final days of the war, the sector was thought to be impenetrable after the deployment of three of the Patriarch's latest prototype destroyers. They managed to defend the sector with their armament of 20 plasma throwers per ship. The Rhonkar family eventually found a way through this blockade. Sending in a small fleet of heavy fighters, they made a successful kamikaze run against the command vessel. Finally a combined Rhonkar - Njy fleet attacked, eliminating the other two prototypes. The Patriarch was captured and deposed. The plans for the destroyers were lost in battle.</t>
 <t id="1030311">(Uranus 3)Without feature or feeling, Uranus stands torn between the grip of the inner system and the hopes of those who have made this silent behemoth their home.</t>
 <t id="1030312">(Jupiter)Massive by even Terran standards, Jupiter's magnificence is rarely lost on those who enter this sector. The planet's upper atmosphere hosts a wide array of semi-organic life, much of which is still under analysis.</t>
 <t id="1030313">(Venus)The bitter crushing winds that envelop Venus are matched only by the tenacity of those who have chosen to colonise this sector. The settlers of Venus take pride in atmospheric farming, their yield being equally acidic as their wit.</t>
 <t id="1030314">(The Moon)In past times, Earth's moon was little more than a glimmer of the dreams held within those who gazed upon it. The cratered surface now glittering with countless refineries and bases, few will ever remember it as being anything more than a stepping-stone to the stars.</t>
 <t id="1030316">(Jupiter 2)Massive by even Terran standards, Jupiter's magnificence is rarely lost on those who enter this sector. The planet's upper atmosphere hosts a wide array of semi-organic life, much of which is still under analysis.</t>
 <t id="1030317">(Jupiter 3)Massive by even Terran standards, Jupiter's magnificence is rarely lost on those who enter this sector. The planet's upper atmosphere hosts a wide array of semi-organic life, much of which is still under analysis.</t>
 <t id="1030321">During a race through the outer territories, Tomasz Tamboursan's ship suffered several malfunctions and as a result he became stranded in this sector. Days later a rescue ship was able to salvage him and his ship. Although filled with many asteroids rich in minerals, nobody had yet claimed this sector. A Freedom's Reach race organiser rewarded a smart pilot with information regarding the whereabouts of the sector after he saved his life, unaware of the secrets and treasures within.</t>
 <t id="1030412">(Asteroid Belt)Miners within this sector are constantly aware that their work is undertaken under the strict scrutiny of security forces, allocated to protect the jump gate recently relocated from Earth. The military presence here is sometimes overwhelming, and often intimidating.</t>
 <t id="1030413">(Mars)Due to draconian security measures placed on Earth access, the USC chose to place their main base of operations in this sector. Those who reside here consider it fitting that the planet, named after the mythical god of war, has become home to the USC.</t>
 <t id="1030414">(Earth)The jewel of Sol system and home to mankind, Earth. While many see similarities to the Argon homeworld, Earth holds grace and beauty that few could deny as being anything other than unique. For this and painful historical reasons, the AGI Task Force zealously guards the planet and the imposing orbital ring station, the Torus.</t>
 <t id="1030415">This sector is home to the disgraced family T'kr, who were held responsible for a tragic incident that destroyed a Split shipyard and killed five hundred Split. What stopped this family from losing all of its assets was the then Patriarch of All Split, using T'kr as a sign to all Split that such incidents will not be tolerated. Now the sector is home to all of the family's assets, and it has been only in recent years that the sector has been visited by other families for trade. The sector also marks the border for the Teladi 'fortune' system block, sectors that the Teladi use for production, also containing the stations that T'kr use as their main source of trade. The family's only destroyer patrols the system.</t>
 <t id="1030508">Sector Is Not Recognised in the Database.</t>
 <t id="1030509">Sector Is Not Recognised in the Database.</t>
 <t id="1030514">Originally discovered and claimed by the Paranid, Heretic's End was used primarily as a remote training area.  Since the activation of the gate to Earth in this sector and the massive battle that ensued between the Kha'ak and a combined Terran and Commonwealth force, Terran forces have annexed this sector with little argument from the Paranid.  The sector has become a buffer zone between Terran and non-Terran space, patrolled by a large contingent of Terran ships.</t>
 <t id="1030601">(CBSW)This crowded system produces high quality wares and resources for the neighbouring systems. In the past, the Goner sect used the orbital temple as a base in their search for the origins of sentient life throughout the known universe. Many spent their lives studying ancient legends and engaging in deep historical analysis that eventually lead to the existence of Earth being proven to be more than just a myth.</t>
 <t id="1030608">Sector Is Not Recognised in the Database.</t>
 <t id="1030609">Sector Is Not Recognised in the Database.</t>
 <t id="1030612">This system is home to the NMMC corporation, formerly known as PTNI. This corporation controls the supply of the rare mineral Nividium and has recently reformed its policies in an attempt to downplay accusations of illegal activity. The sector name has remained unchanged for historical reasons. Its factories produce high-quality weapons for the Teladi as well as other general resources for the two planets in this sector. The system is guarded by the NMMC's security arm as well as Teladi Company ships.</t>
 <t id="1030613">{19,1030000}</t>
 <t id="1030616">This system was once a Split mining outpost. One day a distress signal from the colony was intercepted by Argon Federation security operatives in Black Hole Sun. When they investigated they found the entire system destroyed, its planet a shattered, radioactive hell. There has been no official explanation from any government concerning this disaster although rumours suggest a Xenon super-weapon was to blame. Access to the system is now restricted. Pilots who passed though this system once reported a large ship in this system, but recently these reports have ceased. If this ship existed, its presence and location are currently unknown.</t>
 <t id="1030619">After a failed attempt at securing land from the Njy family, the Zyarth family had no choice but to look elsewhere. Rumours emerged over time that the Ryk family had discovered a new system which they were soon planning to occupy. However, because of a lack of resources, they kept such knowledge a closely guarded secret - or so they thought. Acting upon data collected from their spies, the Zyarth family moved in quickly and established a colony, much to the Ryk family's anger.</t>
 <t id="1030620">After establishing their primary system to the anger of the Ryk family, the Zyarth patriarch gained the friendship of the Njy family and secured resources to establish their second system. Zyarth's Dominion was formed bordering a dangerous Xenon system.</t>
 <t id="1030621">{19,1030000}</t>
 <t id="1030622">(Xenon Sector 695)One of the most heavily entrenched of the Xenon sectors, 695 is surprisingly sparse in its population. Many of the core assets and components are presumably allocated higher priority in other Xenon-controlled sectors closer to borders of conflict.</t>
 <t id="1030721">(Xenon Sector 627)A recent discovery, and one which caused some degree of concern, 627 shows signs of being the gateway to further Xenon sectors. Long-range scout vessels have yet to mark any confirmed transit vectors.</t>
 <t id="1030722">(Xenon Sector 023)023 is known to be another core Xenon sector. Communications protocol handling and re-coding for ship A.I. is known to take place in many of the stations here. Intercept and Attack patrols are carried out by Xenon vessels of all classes, many only discovered recently.</t>
 <t id="1030809">(Legend's Home OTAS HQ Sector)Unmarked on all public-access navigational systems, until recently this sector simply did not exist. Rumours were ruthlessly quashed until Legend's Home was ready to be born; and so until then, OTAS perfected their military and technological might in secret. Their Core sector is now open, heavily defended, and still deeply engaged in Research and Development. Tread lightly.</t>
 <t id="1030815">{19,1030000}</t>
 <t id="1030817">The original name for this sector was Light of Hope, until the Xenon attacked many years ago. It was clear that the sectors patrols wouldn't hold out against further attacks, so the colony was prepared for evacuation using small transport ships. Backup from the Argon Military was sent; four Titan class Destroyers and two Colossus Carriers, complete with fighter wings. They were to escort the transport ships out of the system, but before they could get to the gate, Xenon ships jumped in and overwhelmed the fleet. All civilian ships escaped alongside a lone destroyer, the Challenger. Three years later, a joint Argon-Boron force took back Light of Hope and it was renamed Wastelands, reflecting the carnage and debris that the force found. Now cleared of that detritus and with the Xenon threat greatly diminished, its inhabitants strive to maintain a normal existence.</t>
 <t id="1030821">(Tears of Greed TELADI)The Teladi marked this sector as a hub for all commerce involving mining and food production. Choosing not to invest too far too soon, further sector discoveries were sold to the Boron, gaining further profit from the trade lane created. Tears of Greed was born upon the countless Teladi who had invested heavily on further sector development, their only choice to return to their homeworlds broken and bankrupt.</t>
 <t id="1030909">{19,1030000}</t>
 <t id="1030912">(Homily of Perpetuity)The eternal story, of growth and development, profit and expansion; all of these things are the very essence of Teladi commerce. This Core sector specialises in high-tech goods and energy production. There are rumours that the story does not end within this region. Many will attest to the Teladi proverb that there is profit in exploration. </t>
 <t id="1030914">{19,1030000}</t>
 <t id="1030915">(Argon Sector M148)Fully militarised, all traffic within this sector is marked for intense scrutiny. Nominal access to Shipyard and Equipment Dock facilities are authorised once security clearance has been confirmed. Any interference with military affairs will be dealt with by lethal and overwhelming force.</t>
 <t id="1031002">The last great Duke once visited this sector. After a few short hours he collapsed and fell into unconsciousness. When he woke up he claimed he had visions of a great battle in this system between the Paranid and a strange alien race, now known to be the Kha'ak. The Great Duke decided to consult the monks at the Great Monastery on Paranid Prime in the valley of the setting star. His visions did not occur again and he was granted permission to set up a new temple in this system where he first had his vision. He died without ever knowing the true nature of his visions, or the horror that would follow. </t>
 <t id="1031005">This sector was once the furthest Paranid system from Paranid Prime and it held that title for several decades. Despite this, the Xaarist Priests ran Preacher's Refuge with strict religious fervour and propriety. Their quiet and devoted worker-monks produced exquisite jewellery, inspirational 'Xja' poetry and the very best in automated, semi-intelligent weapons. In recent times, the focus has shifted to sophisticated technology production and interspecies trade has boomed, but the religious extremism remains, hidden in the shadows.</t>
 <t id="1031012">(Acquisition Repository TELADI/PIRATE)Currently contested by both Pirate and Teladi forces, this sector is profitable and deadly in equal measure. Diplomacy is carried out with shields raised and targets locked. Your presence may be considered a threat to either side.</t>
 <t id="1031016">Providing further evidence that 'someone' can reconfigure jumpgate links, this sector was found during the Terran expansion into the galaxy, having previously gone undiscovered by Terran fleets hundreds of years ago. No further information exists regarding this sector.(Terran Unknown Sector 2)</t>
 <t id="1031018">(Gaian Star PIRATE SECTOR)Held by Pirate forces consumed with a deep and abiding hatred for the legend of Gunne, Gaian Star is bathed in the blood of countless Goner priests who attempted to turn the tide of aggression. Some Goner sects believe the spirit of Gunne himself turned the skies red in his rage at the loss of so many souls in his name.</t>
 <t id="1031019">{19,1030000}</t>
 <t id="1031101">(Weaver's Tempest)Home to the Yaki, the most deadly and ruthless of pirates, Kailan Weaver founded this sector after the largest pirate offensive ever known against Split forces attempting to gain a permanent foothold. Her stunning victory, with calculated strikes that bore the mark of military precision, won her the honour and respect of the Split, and a sector now dedicated to her memory.</t>
 <t id="1031108">(Gunne's Crusade PIRATE-ARGON SECTOR)A known haven for pirate forces, the sector was recently discovered after an attack in Montalaar lead Argon security forces to their jump-point. The Argon continue to deploy forces in an effort to take this sector once and for all. Many believe the battle will last far longer than the Argon are willing to admit.</t>
 <t id="1031110">This dark system is located on the far edge of the Garenisk Void, a large area of space where no stars can form. The remnants of an ancient battle were found in this system by a Boron fleet on its first pass through this system. Subsequently many years of archaeology and recovery were undertaken with the assistance of the Argon. After the system was cleared of debris, Boron colonial ships were cleared to move in, but the jump into the system did not go as planned. On entry, they found themselves in the middle of a pirate ambush. The fourteen colonial passenger and freighter ships were destroyed with the capture of some smaller craft. Over two thousand Boron were killed. The pirates have since planted a large minefield in the hope of capturing other ships; travel through this system should be undertaken with great care.</t>
 <t id="1031112">(Spaceweed Grove TELADI-PIRATE SECTOR)Despite a growing Teladi presence in this sector, and plans to take over control, pirate forces in this sector simply don't care. Perhaps mindful that the primary commerce here involves narcotics, the Teladi are happy to take advantage of the situation.</t>
 <t id="1031114">(Aldrin UNKNOWN-TERRAN)Many believed Aldrin to be lost if not completely destroyed centuries ago. Now, the "Lost Colony", recovered from the void of space, is home to those who have made good use of surviving terraformer ships, still benevolent from their isolation. Their offering of secrets long-forgotten gives hope for the continued survival of all races.</t>
 <t id="1031115">This sector was once a quiet area, in which the only feature was the deactivated jumpgate drifting lifelessly in orbit of the planet Armstrong. With the growing Terran interest in the jumpgate, this area of space quickly transformed into a thriving hub where technology and knowledge are traded between the two peoples.(Aldrin 2)</t>
 <t id="1031116">This long-lost frontier sector was once part of the Terran drive to explore the gate network. It now bears the scars of rampant Terraformers who transformed the planet into an unforgiving wasteland, denying the colonial inhabitants a quick death.(Terran Unknown Sector 1)</t>
 <t id="1031117">New Portsmouth, the principal settlement of the planet Terranova, is still intact after the Terraformer war. Its population fled the planet soon after the first Terraformer entered the sector. After a battle in low orbit, the Terran ships managed to retreat to the next sector. The Terraformers destroyed only the planet's ecosystem and climate, curiously leaving artificial structures undamaged.(Terran Unknown Sector 3)</t>
 <t id="1031118">Once planned as a mining colony, this sector fell under the Terraformers' control early in the conflict. They quickly overwhelmed the colonising ships and began Terraforming the planet relentlessly until it was no longer suitable for life. Some of the Xenon in this sector show battle scars of Commonwealth origin, supporting the theory that they used the Hub to traverse between the Commonwealth and this Terran frontier region, where they evolved.</t>
 <t id="1031119">{19,1030000}</t>
 <t id="1031205">(Rhonkar's Trial BORON-SPLIT SECTOR)Originally held by the Boron, there remains an uneasy truce here. Several high-ranking members of Family Rhonkar, accused of unauthorised attempts to purge the sector of all Boron occupation, were placed on trial and summarily executed for genocide. While time has eased the pain of those who remember, forgiveness is far from forthcoming.</t>
 <t id="1031207">(Clarity's End ARGON/PARANID Sector)Long-range scout patrols from Cardinal's Domain ventured upon this sector at the same time as the arrival of a mining expedition from Aladna Hill. The resulting tensions did little but re-open old wounds. Few Paranid would deny the opportunity to fan the flames of a war brought over from the old world.</t>
 <t id="1031208">(Third Redemption ARGON PARANID Sector)Caught between the expansion of both races, the Paranid hold this sector while facing continual incursions from the Argon. It serves as a place of rest for those known as The Fallen, priests who have lost their way amongst the stars. Redemption comes to all, in time.</t>
 <t id="1031209">(Perdition's End)Perdition's flames brought fear to the hearts of both Argon and Paranid, and fury and rage from both sides have quenched the firestorm that burned through this sector. Perdition's end may soon be near, but the fires of conquest still burn brightly.</t>
 <t id="1031215">{19,1030000}</t>
 <t id="1031217">This sector has been recently identified as a Kha'ak sector. Although several patrols have successfully navigated this sector, entering this sector is not recommended without heavy backup.</t>
 <t id="1031304">(Wretched Skies PIRATE/BORON/SPLIT)Those who enter here do so for two reasons alone. To kill or be killed. Executor squads routinely patrol, laying in wait for pilots escorted into the sector to face their final moments before being taken by the void. The outer rim is littered with the corpses and wreckage of the damned and the wretched.</t>
 <t id="1031305">(The Shallows BORON/SPLIT)Originally deemed to be impossible to settle due to deeply drifting nebulae, The Shallows remained largely unpopulated. With recent solar flares having helped to clear the nebulae, building has continued at greater depths. Both Split and Boron forces currently contest this area, both eager to regain lost ground.</t>
 <t id="1031309">(Desecrated Skies PIRATE/PARANID)Savaged by conflict and greed, this sector remains in turmoil. Internal power-struggles between pirate factions leave any entry to this sector one of great risk. Paranid attempts to cleanse this sector are frequent and forceful.</t>
 <t id="1031313">(Perpetual Sin PARANID)This sector, when discovered by the Paranid, was awash with Kha'ak.  Paranid forces had daily skirmishes with them until one day, the Kha'ak completely disappeared from the sector, never to be seen there again.</t>
 <t id="1031315">This sector has been recently identified as a Kha'ak sector. Although several patrols have successfully navigated this sector, entering this sector is not recommended without heavy backup.</t>
 <t id="1031316">{19,1030000}</t>
 <t id="1031319">(Bright Profit TELADI)Benefiting from both the protection of the nearby Pirate Base, as well as business in the more illicit of wares, Bright Profit strikes a fine balance between conflict and trade. Skirmishes are rare, and usually due to intoxication of one kind or another.</t>
 <t id="1031409">Formed shortly after the claiming of the sector to the south, this sector was set up originally as a monastery. It provided a place for passing priests to pray and hold quiet meditation. Military forces were virtually non-existent during early settlement, leaving the monastery open to attack by raiding parties from the nearby Pirate sectors. The priests held their position in the safety of the temple caverns for several days before the Paranid managed to send a destroyer to protect its holy populace. The destroyer has now moved to the next sector to prevent such incursions into Paranid territory.</t>
 <t id="1031415">{19,1030000}</t>
 <t id="1031416">Thought to be the location of a Kha'ak Hive, many have speculated that this sector could be the main source of the recent Kha'ak attacks. Few pilots return from this sector alive.</t>
 <t id="1031417">{19,1030000}</t>
 <t id="1031418">(Sanctity of Corruption TELADI)The Teladi who settled this region chose to do so not entirely out of the desire for profit. Knowing all too many sectors flourished from under-handed deals and kick-backs, business here remains both noble and honest, for now at least.</t>
 <t id="1031419">(Company Strength TELADI)Forging ahead with the combined strength of a mining and military operation, the Teladi have strengthened their foothold in the new colonies with this sector. Their plans however do not rest within these gates alone.</t>
 <t id="1031512">(Duke's Citadel SECRET PARANID MIL SEC)The Priest Duke brought this sector into being with only one thought. Overwhelming firepower. Heavily militarised, with both Shipyard and Equipment Dock facilities, it is both Citadel and Fortress. Your presence here will not go unnoticed.</t>
 <t id="1031518">(Queen's Retribution BORON)In striking out against the growing conflict with the Split, Menelaus established this sector to be the first in the new colonies. A Core sector, specialising in technological and military output, hell hath no fury greater than a Queen's retribution.</t>
 <t id="1031519">(Hollow Infinity BORON)The Boron have established this sector to take advantage of the resources needed for growth of military and technological industry and nearby sectors. Agricultural and mineral output is both secure and of considerable volume.</t>
 <t id="1031604">{19,1030000}</t>
 <t id="1031608">{19,1030000}</t>
 <t id="1031611">(Heaven's Assertion PARANID)The Priest Xaar ordained this sector in clear understanding that the nearby nova was seen by many to be a gateway to higher dimensions. Deemed secure enough for a strong agricultural and mining operation, it also proved to be a gateway to the Split expansion, and a means by which to curtail further Boron growth.</t>
 <t id="1031615">(Patriarch's Collusion SPLIT)One of the Split's more remote Core sectors with a moderate output of agricultural products. Military operations here serve as a base for the building conflict in nearby sectors. Tension with the Boron is already high and set to escalate.</t>
 <t id="1031616">(Contorted Dominion SPLIT/BORON)The Split have chosen to maintain this sector as little more than a trench upon which to launch further attacks against the Boron in nearby sectors. Boron incursions are routine, as they struggle to regain control. There is little here that does not involve war or conquest.</t>
 <t id="1031617">(Faded Dreams SPLIT/BORON)The Boron colonised this sector with dreams of such magnificence even the Queen offered her blessings. Flourishing for a great while, such dreams indeed became reality until the Split discovered and gained control over the connecting sector. Trade turned to war and dreams once cherished were left faded and broken.</t>
 <t id="1031618">(Queen's Harbour BORON)Specialising in food and power storage technology, Queen's Harbour offers a wide array of wares. It is used as a re-supply point for many major passenger transports, and on occasion, the Queen's own personal carrier.</t>
 <t id="1031619">(Menelaus' Oasis BORON)Once a haven for the Queen herself, Menelaus no longer retreats here in times of trouble. Conflict in nearby sectors has borne a wealth of agriculture, high-tech goods and military hardware needed to supply the war front.</t>
 <t id="1031703">(Vestibule of Creation PIRATE)Once thought by the Paranid to be a portal to the Ancients, such beliefs were quickly quashed in the realisation that Pirate signalling beacons were the cause of their delusion. After an embarrassing retreat, this sector became the domain of the lawless.</t>
 <t id="1031708">{19,1030000}</t>
 <t id="1031711">{19,1030000}</t>
 <t id="1031716">(Thyn's Excavation SPLIT)Holding the Strong Arms HQ, Thyn's Excavation provides funds and resources for the ongoing conflict in Veil of Delusion. Naturally this has extended to arms shipments wherever else they are needed. For the Split, the price of war is never too high.</t>
 <t id="1031717">(Veil of Delusion PIRATE)This sector began life in relative peace, both sides sharing resources equally. Open conflict between the Split and Boron soon changed that. Now a mire of lawlessness, the Boron no longer have the resources needed to simultaneously engage both Pirate and Split forces.</t>
 <t id="1031719">{19,1030000}</t>
 <t id="1032024">(Temporary Sector for Unfocussed Jumpdrive){19,1030000}</t>
 <t id="1033000">{19,1030321}</t>
 <t id="1033005">The discovery of this intriguing sector has been a welcome distraction for the neighbouring Argon, who are facing conflict. Each star in this trinary system has a distinctively different composition as well as a very active solar cycle. Initial attempts to build stations in this sector failed when violent solar activity forced an evacuation. The lone planet is a barren world, gravitationally locked with the central star. Studies of its surface will hopefully answer questions about this sector's past and suggest colonisation options for the future. The Argon Government has warned against building new stations or visiting in modestly-shielded ships, for fear of another solar event. Some entrepreneurs, looking to exploit the energy of the suns, have completely ignored any warnings.</t>

 <t id="10011">Today, the Argon Federation is wealthy and encompasses a large number of very different types of planets. Some are deserts while others are icy wastes. The planet Argon Prime is the heart of the Federation and is the seat of the government and all other administration. It is also one of the most exciting planets in the X Universe. Not only is it the home of culture, science and learning, one can also find the finest entertainment. In addition to the finest Geodesic Holiday homes it also offers thousands of bars, restaurants, theatres, casinos, holosuites, cinemas, holiday villas, everything, in fact, that makes it the finest rest and recreation centre in any known universe.\n\nThe Argon Federation is governed by an elected parliament. Each city, colony and space station represented by senators elected by their electorate. The leader of the Argon Parliament is called President.  Currently, a male Argon called Frann Herron holds this position.</t>
 <t id="10012">The Argon build the most balanced ships in the X-Universe. One can see the Boron influence that mirrors their joint development. When you buy an Argon ship you get a good all-around, versatile vessel. In addition, since the Argon do not share the peaceful nature of the Boron, you may be able to install the Mass Driver Gatling gun. This weapon was developed according to specifications found in some old documents.  The Split were so impressed by this weapon that they paid enormous licensing fees so that they could manufacture it as well.\n\nWith the development of the Nova, an M3 class fighter and successor of the aging Elite, the Argon were the first race to install a rear turret in a heavy fighter. Technologically advanced shipyards enable the Argon to build better ships by increasing shield capacity and improving engine performance. Whereas, in the past, you may have laughed about the old Elite, it is a different story today. Although the Nova is still one of the slowest heavy fighters, her fire power will quickly silence any critics.  Similar upgrades were installed in the Buster, an M4 fighter, and the newly introduced Argon Centaur Corvette, while the Elite has since been redesigned and brought back into service.</t>
 <t id="10021">The Boron are famous for their wisdom, wealth and the sophistication of their space ships throughout the X Universe. Boron ships have a shimmering green tint to them. They are equipped with powerful engines and are among the fastest and most manoeuvrable ships in the universe. They are also armed with very sophisticated weapons and defensive shields and, with the exception of the Argon, are among the best spacecraft you can buy.\n\nBecause of their peaceful nature the Boron are friends to all races in the X Universe despite their membership in the Foundation Guild and their strong alliance with the Argon. They currently hold trading agreements with both the Teladi and the Paranid, however, they are still very wary of the Split and relationships between the two races are strained.\n\nThe Boron have no direct contact with the Xenon, however, because of their relationship with the Argon, they are very much aware of them and of the threat they represent.  Despite being called the Kingdom of Boron,  they are actually ruled by an elected government. They do however have a royal family who act as figureheads of the Kingdom State.\n\nThe current head of this Royal Family is the 50-year-old Queen Atreus.  Her husband, King Rolk, was killed in a space cruiser when it crash-landed on a nearby space station, leaving their daughter, Princess Menelaus, as the heir apparent.</t>
 <t id="10022">In the past, the Boron have cooperated very closely with the Argon design engineers even though their aggressive nature was never fully understood by the Boron. The constant threat of assault from the over aggressive Split has pushed more recent Boron ship designs to move away from their peaceful nature. Advanced Ion weaponry and unique propulsion systems have led to a drastic reduction in raids by Split pilots.  When compared to Argon ships, the new Boron ships are just as fast and with equivalent armament but with weaker shields.</t>
 <t id="10031">To this day the Split continue to control large territories that used to belong to the kingdom of Boron. They continue to exploit the rare Markus Spacefly as a propellant in their ships but they also continue to effectively trade with the Profit Guild. While the relationship between the Foundation Guild and the Profit Guild remains cordial, on the surface anyway, the relationship between the Split and the other races is continually degenerating and now borders on the edge of war. This due equally to the natural aggressiveness of the Split and the continued abuse of the Markus Spacefly.\n\nEven though the Boron are a peaceful race, they are always eager to reclaim their lost territories and don't miss any opportunity to attack the Split. The Argon are suspicious of the Split's alleged friendship with the Xenon even though the Split and Xenon barely tolerate each other.  They were at war at one time but when neither side could see an easy victory or any territory to be gained, they came to terms. However, this treaty is very shaky and a new war is expected if their association deteriorates much further. The Split maintain a frosty friendship with the Paranid but will never forgive them for not engaging in the fight against the Xenon when the Split needed them.</t>
 <t id="10032">The Split firmly believe in the axiom that if you can't eliminate your enemy with the first shot, get a bigger gun or get more support. They are impatient and have an insatiable need to be the first to join any conflict.  In ship construction, therefore, shields take a backseat. In one particular construction project, shields were retrofitted because they were left out in the design. Their engineers still complain about it today, citing a missed opportunity to fit the ship with more weapons.\n\nNevertheless, Split ships are some of the best combat ships built. If you are willing to live with weaker shields then you trade that for the strongest and deadliest weapons.\n\nIt was with extreme reluctance that a few Split traders had Ion Disrupters fitted into their cargo bays only to discover that they could use them to hunt Spaceflies. That is why the Split personnel transporters, the most luxurious and lavishly outfitted ship used for hunting parties, can be fitted with the Ion Disruptor.</t>
 <t id="10041">The Paranid are allied with the Split even though there have been many disagreements between them. They are also allied with the Teladi because both races are members of the Profit Guild. For this reason the Paranid allow all other races to trade freely throughout their territory.  However, because of strained relations between the Paranid and the Argon, trade is the only contact these two races have with each other.  They adhere strictly to their ancient and strange rites and religious beliefs which are a mystery to other races. It is virtually impossible to befriend or even understand them. Their religion also forbids non Paranid to settle or live in a Paranid colony. This law is really of little consequence because very few outsiders are interested in settling in Paranid colonies. This is due to the fact that the Paranid prefer to settle on planets that are much too hot and humid for other races.</t>
 <t id="10042">The Paranid have always understood how to construct good combat ships. They have the best fighting capabilities of all the fleets in the X-Universe. Unfortunately, their designers have little imagination and only required functionality is added to their ships. Comfort is discarded for more practical amenities. But, if you are looking for a ship that will still be intact after a heavy skirmish, a Paranid ship would make an excellent choice.\n\nIt was Paranid engineers who developed the Phased Shockwave Generator and the Fragmentation Bomb Launcher. Both of these weapons are designed to have a wider area of fire than your standard issue laser.\n\nThe Paranid were forced to sell the designs of the Particle Accelerator Cannon to the other races during their recent recession which some have said, with much sneering, was caused because of the small cargo bays in their ships. The sale of plans for any future weapons was prohibited by the Paranid secret service.</t>
 <t id="10051">Most of the races in the X Universe don't like the Teladi and refer to them as greedy and lazy. Sometimes they are even referred to as stupid but that is only by races that have never done business with them. The Teladi drive some of the hardest bargains in the X Universe and always come out of a situation with a profit. This is the primary reason why certain races have banned the Teladi from trading in their territories or sectors. Consequently, the Teladi are always on the lookout for new trading partners. It is believed that they finance many of the pirate factions that operate throughout the X Universe. Indeed, many races believe that it is no coincidence that their ships have been captured and their high-tech equipment looted by pirates after refusing to trade with the Teladi.\n\nTheir own technology tends to lag behind the rest of the occupants of the X Universe but, being Teladi, they would rather buy and trade for what they need than spend their money in research and development.  Hence, the Teladi have access to all the high-tech equipment, engines and weapons technology of practically all the other races.</t>
 <t id="10052">The skill of the Teladi is not the ability to sell water to a Boron swamp runner, as is claimed by some, but rather the ability to adapt anything they can lay their claws on. Their own technology is pretty much outdated and since they prefer to trade rather than develop, they manage to use most anything in their ships. Consequently, when looking at their fleet, they have the broadest spectrum of upgrades, weapons and shields. Their ships move rather slowly in comparison to others but with lots of cargo space and strong shields. You should not underestimate them.\n\nTheir combat ships are usually late on the scene but when they do get there they are usually efficient in their job.\n\nSince the Teladi have friendly trade relations with all organic races, including the Pirates, they can usually rely on their help if attacked. There is currently a rumour about a new Teladi M6 prototype which is said to be better equipped than anything seen so far. At a secret trial run the Split, supposedly trying to attack the ship with two of their own M6 class ships, were so impressed by it that they decided to forego their usual ridicule of its snail-like speed.</t>
 <t id="10061">Today, the Xenon are somewhat of an enigma. There is no known contact between the Xenon and any other race. They do not belong to any of the guilds.  They do not use Credits nor is it known what, if any, currency they use. They appear to have no interest in the technology of or to trade with other races. The location of the Xenon home planet, if there is one, has never been discovered in spite of many attempts to do so. Nor does anyone know the exact size of the territory that the Xenon control. Hence, on most star maps, possible Xenon sectors are only marked with a question mark and a warning to be cautious.  Not many ships dare venture into these regions of space and, regrettably, many ships brave enough to do so have never been heard from again. The Xenon, if the robot psychologists are to be believed, seem to be ever increasing in self awareness, consciousness and understanding of themselves. Whether this development is a step in the right direction is still undecided since the Xenon continue to attack first and don't bother asking questions afterwards.\n\nA special covert operations department of the Argon Federation Space Academy based on Argon Prime has researched the Xenon for many years and is currently engaged in documenting and cross referencing all confirmed Xenon ship sightings.  Unnamed sources inside the department suggest that there are plans to finance an undercover expedition deep into the Xenon territory in an attempt to locate the Xenon home world.</t>
 <t id="10062">Xenon ships are very aggressive. Their only directive is "If it moves, shoot it down". They are fast, heavily armed and well protected.</t>
 <t id="10071">The Kha'ak is a hive race in which the individual only exists to serve the hive. A Kha'ak will sacrifice himself to that end without question. The Kha'ak's goal appears to be the destruction of the universe.  They employ a cluster configuration in which their interceptors, scouts and fighters group together and break apart at will in order to better engage the enemy. Despite their increasing presence in the universe there is still very little known about them;  their origin, how many of them there are or what their true intentions are, although there are rumours linking them with Nividium.\n\nIt is interesting to observe how Kha'ak ships behave.  If you have ever seen a flock of birds suddenly change direction you might agree that it's an amazing sight.  Kha'ak fighters emulate this behaviour when they chase a patrol ship. Once their target is destroyed they will turn as one and take on their next victim. You may see this yourself one day and your reaction will change very quickly from fascinated amazement to gut-wrenching horror when you realize that you are their next chosen victim. The Kha'ak turn everyone and everything they encounter into space debris.  They take no prisoners.</t>
 <t id="10072">Their ships are of an unusual pyramid shape and resemble crystalline structures.</t>
 <t id="10081">Pirates are not a race in themselves but groups of like-minded criminals who specialize in all sorts of illegal activities. They have their own bases, usually hidden from view and well defended. Most pirate bases have large fleets of ships and will send out raiding patrols on a regular basis. They are known to be very aggressive and if they spot you across the sector they may start heading your way.  If you encounter pirates, you can report them after you have scanned a pirate ship for illegal goods with you freight scanner. Note: you can't see what's in the cargo hold without first scanning the ship and that scanning is illegal if you don't have a local police license.</t>
 <t id="10082">You will encounter pirate vessels of all types since pirates use other races' ships, modified for their own ends. The wealthy pirate groups even have their own custom ship designs, often including non-standard ship colours.\n\nDo not confuse pirates with smugglers who are much cleverer by using normal ships to conceal their activities.</t>
 <t id="10091">Seven hundred years in the past, Earth colonists were trapped in the X-Universe. They made a new home on the planet now known as Argon Prime. At the same time, the terraforming Xenon machines took over the sectors east of President's End. Most of these became Pirate sectors after the Xenon war.\n\nThe Argon called the colonists Gunners, naming them after their leader, Nathan R. Gunne who explored the universe in an effort to find a way back to Earth. The details of their story became obscured in the centuries that followed and became known as The Truth. Even their name became distorted and they became known as the Goners. The Goners worked in harmony with the Argon and spread the "good news" about the existence of a glorious planet called Earth to other races.\n\nGoners use the "Book of Truth" as their spiritual and philosophical guide and in their temple they have "Beholders of the Truth". Their leader is Noah Gaffelt, an old man with a white beard. Norma Gardna, a noted female Beholder of the Truth and second in command, died on Argon Prime due to a sickness and was replaced by Lynda North. The "Book of Truth" is said to contain extensive knowledge about Earth, which has found itself in high demand due to recent events.</t>
 <t id="10092">While the Goner Ranger was the only ship known to be in use by the Goners, with their growing needs and numbers following the recent "rediscovery" of Earth, there are rumours of larger Goner ships. Due to their extremely peaceful nature, Goners ships are totally unarmed.  The Ranger is quite fast and is also considered to be a good short range freighter due to its large cargo space. It is also capable of carrying shields compatible with some M3 fighters. You will probably see this ship roaming all sectors spreading the word of the Goners and Nathan R. Gunne.</t>
 <t id="10181">The Terrans are the inhabitants of Earth. They are a technologically advanced race, but their suspicion of other races, including their lost cousins, the Argon, motivated them to be protective of their territory.\nTo shield Earth from alien races, they moved their only jump gate to a secluded location and a substantial military presence now buffers the void between the Solar System and the Commonwealth.\nThe Terrans built only two jump gates, all other gates were built by a mysterious people only known as "The Ancients".\nIn the year 2066 \(Earth date\) the Terrans started to send terraforming ships into the depths of space.\nThese were later followed by self-replicating machines. After several years the terraforming project was discontinued but their attempts to cancel the terraforming process failed because the terraformers had become sentient and the machines became known as the Xenon.\n\nSeveral years after that, the Xenon attacked the Earth and tried to destroy their creators and everything they stood for. This was the Xenon invasion. In a brave tactical manoeuvre, Nathan R. Gunne led the Xenon fleet through a jump gate to what is now known as Brennan's Triumph. He then destroyed the gate that led back to Earth. He would never see his home planet again.</t>
 <t id="10191">The ruthless Yaki pirates have taken advantage of the weakened Argon fleet to carry out raids on Argon facilities and many other sectors in the X-Universe.  The Yaki Pirates are becoming a real force to be reckoned with. Their activities have all the hallmarks of deliberate creation of chaos and confusion in order to undermine law and order throughout the universe.  They are known for their frequent attacks on isolated traders because they are easy targets, often without fighter escorts.</t>

 <t id="375201">Hey, I'm told you're the Boron liaison guy. The Yaki have appeared to have given up raiding Bala Gi's labs but they did manage to steal some high-level stuff. It's likely they want to reverse-engineer some of the technology, so we need to investigate their sectors. We need you to take a look around in Ocracoke's Storm. Take out any enhanced ships you can find. Good luck.</t>
 <t id="375202">Good to see you back in one piece. Looking at this data you collected, I'd bet my left cahoona that the station surrounded by mines is what we're looking for. It's likely to be where they're researching the tech they stole. None of the other sectors contained anything nearly as interesting for us to blow up. This station is of particular interest, if you catch my drift. The bulk of the fleet is standing by, just take out those mines and we'll head on in.</t>

AGI, that's Xenon to you, I guess, have been attacking this sector for the last month. The USC and ATF are holding out fine but anyone with experience fighting the Xenon would be of great use to us. Lieutenant Gellet, do you have anyone in mind?</t>
 <t id="141007">How about you, pilot? You handled yourself well out there. The USC is not really any different to the Argon Military except that you will be treated as an emissary and will receive access to many of our superior technologies. Contact me if you are interested.</t>
 <t id="141008">That's great news! The USC have granted you basic access to the Solar System. I'm sure your background and connections in the Commonwealth will be very useful to us. Proceed to Uranus sector. Your first mission is there.</t>

 <t id="161001">Ah, our new recruit. Good to meet you. My name is Lieutenant Plinter, I'm your flight leader. The USC is very interested in you and what you are capable of. Most of our boys have never fought against anything before but from what I hear, skirmishes are commonplace in the Commonwealth. Well, let's get this little tour on the way.</t>
 <t id="161101">Hello, pilot. This is Lt. Plinter, USC. You drew patrol assignment today. Come join us when you are ready.</t>
 <t id="161102">Right. Let's move out.</t>
 <t id="161103">Nothing on my screen, pilot. It's probably a micro-meteorite. Sometimes one will enter the transit accelerator and shoot across the populated area. They do register on the grav sometimes if they're heavy enough.</t>
 <t id="161104">Huh. I see them now. Five of them. They must have disintegrated during transit. Perhaps (interrupted)</t>
 <t id="161105">What? Terraformer? It's been over 20 years since... (interrupting himself)You heard the Captain, people. Break orbit and set course for Neptune. Follow my lead. Execute!</t>
 <t id="161106">Copy that. (towards his group)People, look out for that beacon.</t>
 <t id="161107">Drones? So the tracks on the grav were no micro-meteorites after all! All right, pilot, you're up! Blow those damn things out of the sky. Good luck. Execute.</t>
 <t id="161108">The drones are heading for the Oort Cloud. Pilot, get in there and follow the next one.</t>
 <t id="161109">Another Drone is heading into Oort Cloud. Intercept it.</t>
 <t id="161110">Local forces in Oort Cloud are ready to intercept the Drone but you should get close and gather intel and attempt to destroy that drone.</t>
 <t id="161111">Pilot, this is Lt. Plinter. I've got message from command that all drones are either destroyed or intercepted. Command is mighty impressed with your achievements today - and I am too.</t>
 <t id="161112">Alright, debrief at the Saturn Research Station; they want to get as much sensor data as possible. I hear the scientists already have their hands full ripping open half the fleet's black boxes so there is no rush.</t>
 <t id="161113">Pilot, you've been ordered to meet with Major General Ishiyama at the ATF Outpost in the Asteroid Belt. Seems you're getting yourself noticed, pilot!</t>
 <t id="161201">Hello, pilot. This mission is a simple escort run through to Venus. We've got USC and ATF ships all over the place so we won't run into any trouble. The top brass will be watching, so keep in formation and try not to run into anything. Let's move.</t>

 <t id="181103">We've got new intel suggesting that this is just a decoy attack! A handful of AI drones have sneaked past our guard and stolen information from a research facility in Mars orbit. They're already heading back into the outer system, possibly to rendezvous with a ship.</t>
 <t id="181104">Lt. Plinter, you'll be sending one of your pilots to the Oort Cloud to patrol the gate just in case one of the drones gets there. It must then be followed to its destination and, if possible, destroyed.</t>

We are going to get to the source of these Terraformers and when that time comes we will count on people like you to eliminate it. The source may well be in the Commonwealth so remain vigilant. We have something which may interest you. An Argon Discoverer which we have been studying. We have upgraded it somewhat. Hopefully, you can put it to good use. We will contact you with your next assignment.</t>

 <t id="191000">Pilot. Report to me for your next assignment.</t>
 <t id="191201">Good day, pilot. I'm Major General Rai Ishiyama of the AGI Task Force, or ATF. As you probably know, the ATF is charged with defending the Sol system from illegal Artificial General Intelligences, for short, AGI. These things are pretty nasty - one example of them is the ancient Terraformers, and you know what they did! Well, lately it seems they're returning. This attack on the Sol system was the first of its kind in centuries; more might follow. What worries us most, however, is that apparently some unknown group from outside the Sol system is collaborating with the AGI. We must find out who, where, why and how this is at all possible.</t>
 <t id="191202">The information you intercepted today gives us valuable clues, but we're still working on it. The ship you saw was apparently Argon.</t>
 <t id="191203">We have reports of an Argon ship picking up the drones before it jumped out of the Solar System.</t>
 <t id="191204">You've done exceptionally well, pilot. You have been given access to Mars orbit. As you know, Mars has a wide variety of ship upgrades available, take a look. As you will be taking on more challenging duties, we have seen fit to give you a M5 scout ship to aid you. It is located at the Mars Shipyard. Dock there and control will be turned over to you. Once your business in Mars in complete and you are ready for your next assignment, please contact me.</t>
 <t id="191205">Good day, pilot. As you might be aware, the governments of the Commonwealth are less than welcoming of our presence in their territories. This, however, will not prevent us from leading a thorough investigation, with or without their consent. This is a joint ATF and USC operation and from now on, you're part of it. You are to enter the Commonwealth of Planets in a sector called Heretic's End. There, you'll meet up with ATF Commander Mark Jackson who'll let you in on the details of your next mission. Good luck!</t>
 <t id="191401">Hello again, pilot. I believe congratulations are in order. You and Heywood did a very commendable job in rescuing Captain Pearle. You may already know that we have received a response from the Argon Government but we are denying the charges. Patrols near Heretic's End are being stepped up by both sides. It was inevitable but at least we have Pearle back and a chance of better understanding what is going on.</t>
 <t id="191402">As you know, a previously unknown group of AGI ships have entered the Commonwealth and started attacking some races and factions. Their design is based on the Terraformers, constructed by Earth several centuries ago. At the end of the Terraformer war, we trapped them in the gate network. They further evolved into the Xenon. It now looks like a group of Terraformers did not take that same evolutionary path.</t>
 <t id="191403">Pilot, you and Pearle will investigate two Split factions, the Ryk and Zyarth. They are allies but we do not believe they will share this technology with each other. Track down the source. We still do not have a lead on the Argon who infiltrated the Solar System but I am positive that you will uncover the answers.</t>
 <t id="191404">Pilot, we're getting a solid signal from that tracking device. It won't take them long to realise that we're onto them so we need to act quickly. They entered an unknown sector East of Zyarth's Dominion. We're going to hit them hard and hopefully corner them before they can jump again.</t>
 <t id="191405">Head to that sector. The rest of the fleet will meet you there. I'm adding it to your map now. Good luck, pilot.</t>
 <t id="191406">Hello, pilot. This is a delicate situation. Taking this Split is probably the only way we can get to the bottom of this but we have enough people against us at the moment. This could take a while, pilot. In the meantime, enjoy the view. Not many people from outside the inner planets gain access to the Moon. We will contact you with your next assignment.</t>
 <t id="191501">Pilot, we have information on the Terraformers. The Split acquired the technology to build them from a person named Marteen Winters, a Terran. Winters was presumed dead centuries ago even before the initial Terraformer War. We now assume that he fled and had cryogenically frozen himself. Winters was a scientist who worked on the Terraformers and was against the shutdown of the project. This explains how the Xenon seem to be manipulated. He is without a doubt, the foremost expert of Terraformer and Xenon technology. His motives are obviously against our interests and he must be tracked down and stopped.</t>
 <t id="191502">Aldrin was a colony of Earth. It was set up centuries ago but was lost during the Terraformer war. The Terraformers destroyed every colony we had; at least that is what we thought. The co-ordinates for Aldrin were stolen during the Terraformer attack in the Solar System. Winters may be using Aldrin as a base of operations. Why he chose that system is still unknown. We have reverse-engineered a Jump Beacon and have attempted to send it to the co-ordinates. If it ends up in the correct system the fleet will get the 'green light'.</t>
 <t id="191503">A warm welcome to Earth, pilot. Please dock at the Torus. I will debrief you.</t>

 <t id="45">North gate.</t>
 <t id="46">South gate.</t>
 <t id="47">West gate.</t>
 <t id="48">East gate.</t>
 <t id="201201">Welcome Down South, pilot. That's what we call this rotten place beyond the gate. They call it Commonwealth... How was your journey? In this part of space, you'll get your orders from me - even with the ATF emblem on my sleeve. You'll meet one of your own USC guys, Capt. Pearle, in a few days, if all goes well.</t>
 <t id="201202">Okay. The Terraformers, also known as the Xenon over here in the commonwealth, are acting up a lot these days. They're raiding convoys and facilities for processed materials, we don't know why. Not to mention stealing information from our fair Solar System.</t>
 <t id="201203">It does sound a little far-fetched, but we believe they're being incited, coerced, sweet-talked or otherwise manipulated by our squeaky-clean so-called Argon 'friends'. Anyway, the current wave of Xenon attacks is often accompanied by non-Xenon vessels. We want you to seek out such an attack, and instead of getting into the battle, covertly follow the non-Xenon ship to its base of operations. This is a crucial piece of intel we absolutely need to have. All clear? Okay. You're good to go effective immediately. Carry on, pilot.</t>
 <t id="201204">Pilot, we've confirmed a Xenon attack in Nyana's Hideout.</t>
 <t id="201205">Pilot, we've confirmed a Xenon attack in Scale Plate Green.</t>
 <t id="201206">Pilot, we've confirmed a Xenon attack in PTNI Headquarters (P.T.N.I.)</t>
 <t id="201207">Proceed to this sector A.S.A.P. but do not engage the enemy. Just follow the non-Xenon attacker to its base and if possible, scan it. Jackson out.</t>
 <t id="201208">Welcome back, pilot. You've done an exceptionally good job today. The data you brought in is already being scrutinised by our scientists. We may be able to pinpoint where that ship jumped to.</t>
 <t id="201209">The scan of the base revealed a large area for the stolen material and some kind of signal which is aimed at the Xenon. It may be the way the Argon and Xenon communicate. I doubt the Xenon are under their control but they do seem to share information on raids: co-ordinates, lists of materials and so on.</t>
 <t id="201210">So, right now we're investigating this Argon-Pirate-Xenon connection and what these resources are probably used for. The Xenon fabricate their own material and technology so it probably isn't for them and as far as we know they have never worked with other races before.</t>
 <t id="201211">How do you feel about leading your first patrol, pilot? Berghman and Utashi will be joining you. You will be assigned three unmanned light scouts for you to command by remote. Manpower is a little short on this side of the gate. The scouts are on their way to you now.</t>
 <t id="201212">Ok, pilots. You will be heading to the Argon sectors. Black Hole Sun is your final destination. Take a look around, gauge the Xenon activity and report back. This time, if you see anything, feel free to take it out. Good luck.</t>
 <t id="201213">I received the initial report from Berghman. We are getting the same reports from several other patrols. A seemingly unknown AGI force is attacking the Commonwealth and they look very similar to our old Terraformer technology. We've taken out a few of them and are analysing their construction. the Argon government has filed official protests about that with Earth. Well, that tells a tale, right? A freighter containing the debris needs to be escorted to Venus, for which you have been granted Venus access since you will be part of the escort group. The freighter is standing by. Report to Lieutenant Plinter.</t>
 <t id="201301">Pilot, this is Commander Jackson. These unknown AGI ships look like they are being constructed out of material fabricated in the Commonwealth. They may be creations rather than an evolutionary path of Xenon. Information on Terraformer technology was downloaded during the Solar System incident, among other things. You will meet with an undercover USC operative, Captain Pearle. He has been investigating each race, trying to gauge their true views towards AGI development and their capability. If anyone knows who is behind this, he does. Jackson out.</t>
 <t id="201501">Good to see you again, pilot. We've just been given the 'green light'. I'm sending you the coordinates now. Once on the other side we will form a defensive perimeter and assess the situation. If Winters is there, we can expect Xenon and Terraformer resistance. The priority is to track him down and capture him before he can escape.</t>
 <t id="201502">Wave 1, engage jumpdrives on my mark... now!</t>
 <t id="201503">Wave 2, now!</t>
 <t id="201504">Wave 3, now!</t>
 <t id="201505">Secure the area. Damage report.</t>
 <t id="201506">Any contacts?</t>
 <t id="201507">Confirmed. It looks like there could be several stations in orbit around the planet. Wave 1, secure the beacon. Waves 2 and 3, move out.</t>
 <t id="201508">These stations look like they are of old Earth technology. The reactors are online. Assume defensive formations.</t>
 <t id="201509">It does not appear to be Terraformer or Xenon. It could be Winters. Wave 3, move forward.</t>
 <t id="201510">You're Human. This is Commander Jackson of the AGI Task Force, Earth. Who are you?</t>
 <t id="201511">Is Winters here?</t>
 <t id="201512">A CPU Ship?!</t>
 <t id="201513">Your Terraformers?</t>
 <t id="201514">We can help. Give us his last know position. We need to capture him.</t>
 <t id="201515">Very well, but you're right - we do not have much time.</t>
 <t id="201516">Pilot, take Wave 3 and establish a perimeter around the stations. Keep a look out for Terraformer activity. I will make contact with these people and attempt to find some common ground and the information we need.</t>
 <t id="201517">We have the coordinates. It matches the trajectory of those AGI. Let's move.</t>
 <t id="201518">Pilot, I'm giving you control of one of the boarding craft. Try your best to capture but not destroy the CPU ship. We have a deal with the Aldrin colonists to preserve it.</t>
 <t id="201519">There it is! Prepare to board it. Protect the boarding crews at all costs.</t>
 <t id="201520">Do it, pilot!</t>
 <t id="201521">I'm picking up an Argon ship. Winters!</t>
 <t id="201522">The agreement stands my friend. (Pause)Pilot, we have an important job for you. Please take Takio here and several Aldrin dignitaries to Earth. It will be quite a sight for all of you.</t>

 <t id="211423">I'll be part of the defence group, holding back Split reinforcements coming through the gate. You need to head to the TL and protect boarding craft. Our goal is to paralyse their capability to construct new Terraformers and gain information on where they got this technology.</t>
 <t id="211424">Pilot, protect those boarding craft. They need to send marines onto the TL.</t>
 <t id="211425">One of the escaping ships has been hit. The pilot has ejected. Pilot, pick him up and bring him in.</t>
 <t id="211426">Understood. Pilot, take our guest to the Moon. We're going to get to the bottom of these AGI.</t>
 <t id="211501">We got another name from the Split - Aldrin.</t>
 <t id="211502">Winters may be aboard a large ship or a base. We will be attempting to capture him so marine boarding craft will be used. As you may have gathered, marine boarding is designed for capturing large ships. I'd like to see how you get on. Try capturing this ship here. We are giving you control of the boarding ship now. Have fun, pilot.</t>
 <t id="211503">There are marines onboard the boarding ship ready to go. You will find the command to board a ship in the command console.</t>
 <t id="211504">Pilot, it's not like I don't trust you, but... You'd better practice boarding on that ship over there.</t>
 <t id="211505">Okay, you don't need to.</t>
 <t id="211506">Nicely done. (slightly sarcastic tone)Expect tougher resistance on manned ships though.</t>
 <t id="211507">Commander Jackson will be leading the operation. The fleet is assembling in orbit of The Moon. Speak to Commander Jackson to receive your orders. Good luck, pilot.</t>

 <t id="221301">Bastu, you're late. Follow my ship. Now!</t>
 <t id="221302">Good, this will make talking easier. The Argon may be monitoring us. Sorry about calling you a Bastu. My name is Patricia Heywood, I'm with the ATF. Pearle and I were stationed in these Argon sectors. We obviously stayed too long. From what I gather, a few hours ago, Pearle hacked into an information port on an Argon Trading Station. Minutes later, he was surrounded and taken into custody. He's been taken to a sector controlled by the Argon Military.</t>
 <t id="221303">I've sent a data burst but there is nothing they can do. Pearle and I are undercover, posing as Argon. If one of us gets captured, the USC cannot help without risking open war with the Argon. I don't think we want to go down that path just yet. We need to do this on our own.</t>
 <t id="221304">I know the situation. Someone is building AGI and we need to stop them. You know what AGI is capable of. It may destroy Earth and everything we hold dear for good this time! We have reason to believe that Pearle is close to finding out who is behind it. I have a plan to enter the Military sector. It will take time but I think we can pull it off without a single shot being fired. We need to talk to a Teladi contact in a nearby sector. Let's go.</t>
 <t id="221305">We don't need information today, we need your assistance. Pearle has been captured by the Argon and we need access to the Argon Military Sector M148. You have trade rights to access the sector right? We need to perform a little trade run.</t>
 <t id="221306">Technology is out of the question, as always.</t>
 <t id="221307">We're not here to kill anyone.</t>
 <t id="221308">(To the player)(sigh)So much for 'no shots fired'. Let's be careful, understand? They're 'Down-Southers' and probably betraying us anyway, but we don't want to make a bad thing worse unless we're 100% certain.</t>
 <t id="221309">I see our target. Let's get this over with.</t>
 <t id="221310">Okay, I'm picking up several ships which could be smuggling the spaceweed. I'm highlighting them in your sector map. Scan them for spaceweed. If they turn hostile, you know they are pirates.</t>
 <t id="221311">I'm transporting a freight scanner over to you.</t>
 <t id="221312">You need to get a ship which can hold a freight scanner.</t>
 <t id="221313">Ok, that should be enough. I really didn't enjoy that. I hope the pilots were able to eject before we blew their ships apart. Well, let's get out of here.</t>
 <t id="221314">Looks like you need to get the Argon to like you a little more. Try destroying Xenon in Black Hole Sun or something.</t>
 <t id="221315">Okay, you have the information on the delivery. I'll be flying escort. You will need a freighter for this mission. We dock at the station, I sneak through security, locate Pearle and bust out. How hard can it be?</t>
 <t id="221316">Okay, I'm onboard. I'll get in contact with you when we're on our way out.</t>
 <t id="221317">I've got him but we've got a problem. Argon security are on their way. I don't think we can make it back to the dock. We've got an idea. Standby.</t>
 <t id="221318">We're going to escape the station through an airlock. Pick us up!</t>
 <t id="221319">Right, let's head to that Military sector.</t>

 <t id="231303">That was not what I had in mind but hearing your precious laws and regulations is always exhilarating. An old partner of mine, a fellow Teladi has recently entered the spaceweed market. It is a lucrative area which I have been attempting to enter myself. Unfortunately, my friend has gained the upper hand against me, turning a simple Teladi operation into a profitable pirate drug ring. I am losing customers, my transports are being raided for spaceweed and police checks are slowing me down. I want you to shut down the operation and eliminate my partner.</t>
 <t id="231304">And I'm not ordering you to kill anyone! That would be illegal, wouldn't it? However, this is my offer. Deal with this pirate operation and I will get you access to the Argon sector.</t>
 <t id="231305">(hiss)I just heard from one of my contacts in that sector. You did a good job. Please understand that this business you destroyed was not an honourable one. Now, I have arranged a delivery to the Argon sector M148. Please, try your best to not damage my reputation. Luck and Profit.</t>

 <t id="251502">Earth? You're from Earth! My name is Takio, Makato Takio. I am a Commander in the Aldrin defence force. How did you get here? Did you come for Winters?</t>
 <t id="251503">No, no. We do not know where he is. He came and told us of Earth and the network of gates leading to inhabited worlds. He said he came peacefully but he had important work to do here regarding the Terraformers. He boarded the CPU ship, took control of the Terraformers and flew out of orbit.</t>
 <t id="251504">Yes. It has modified itself over the centuries, adapting to its situation. It is no longer just for terraforming planets; it defends us, collects resources and builds us new Terraformers.</t>
 <t id="251505">Yes. These Terraformers are not like the others. They are still under our control, that is, they were until Winters came. We attempted to go after him but Terraformers blocked our path. Shots were fired and we lost people. The Terraformers retreated but we understood the situation and accepted it. We're not used to losing people, especially not in combat.</t>
 <t id="251506">Time is of the essence. You should talk with my superiors and explain the situation.</t>
 <t id="251507">We have regained communication with the CPU ship. It appears well. You will honour the agreement, Commander? Our CPU ship remains intact, under our control. It is unfortunate that Winters got away. He was not very honourable.</t>
 <t id="251508">Please pick me up at the following station. I look forward to the journey.</t>

 <t id="261401">The crew is attempting to flee the ship. It looks like they set some charges. We're attempting to disarm them.</t>
 <t id="261402">Some of the charges went off and took out some terminals. The ship is secure but they made it so we could not gain information on the AGI. The ship looks nothing more than a mobile factory, not an AGI lab. I'd say they got the know-how from somewhere else.</t>
 <t id="261501">Winters is not here! We're shutting down the Terraformers.</t>

 <t id="282201">Welcome, warrior. I am Fjuny t'Scct(pronounced Fyooni Te-saat) of the great Split family Rhonkar, the appointed commander of Operation Final Fury. As you know, we are in an all-out war with the Kha'ak and we're not going to stop until they're gone from all Commonwealth sectors for good! (Pause)Today, however, you are going to fly a reconnaissance mission inside Kha'ak territory to assess the scale of their activities. You will log everything that you see. You will start immediately. That is all.</t>
 <t id="282202">Well done. (Emotionless)Warrior Jesan Nadina has been killed while deploying a minefield in a Kha'ak sector today. We believe that his ship's flight data recorder is still intact. You will search for it and retrieve it before the Kha'ak find it. Carry on.</t>
 <t id="282203">Very well done. An outpost can now be placed in this forward sector - but your help is not needed there at this point in time. You are ordered to standby until further notice. There will be new orders for you shortly.</t>
 <t id="282302">Warrior, it's been decided by the Committee to create our own local resource chain to become less dependent on supplies from the inner sectors. You are ordered to find at least three high-yield asteroids in the adjacent uncharted sectors. Carry on.</t>
 <t id="282303">Scans received. You are to protect the construction units until the mines are established and their own shields are activated. Carry on.</t>
 <t id="282304">Warrior, the mines require sector defences set up by placing laser towers at the specified coordinates.</t>
 <t id="282402">Just in time, warrior. We have an incoming Teladi nividium convoy that is crucial to the campaign. High levels of Kha'ak activity are expected. It has to be protected at all cost until reinforcements arrive. Good fight! Carry on.</t>
 <t id="282501">Return to Command, warrior!</t>
 <t id="282502">You have fought very well, warrior. But the battle isn't over yet! Our hidden forward outpost has been discovered by the Kha'ak and is under heavy attack. Clear the sector of Kha'ak and prevent the outpost from being destroyed. Reinforcements are on the way. Deploy immediately!</t>
 <t id="282503">Our outpost is still under attack. You are ordered to clear the sector of Kha'ak and prevent the outpost from being destroyed.</t>
 <t id="282601">All warriors are ordered to return to base immediately!</t>
 <t id="282602">Intercept all hostile ships!</t>
 <t id="282603">Your failure has brought dishonour to you. If you are fortunate, I may still allow you the chance to prove your ability in combat at another time.</t>
 <t id="282604">{3828,282609} {3828,282610}</t>
 <t id="282606">Warrior, we require a skilled pilot such as yourself. Protect the friendly ships that are coming in from the gate until they have docked at the base. Their cargo is vital and must be delivered intact.</t>
 <t id="282607">Well done again, warrior. Your skills in combat are beginning to impress me.</t>
 <t id="282608">You will be contacted when needed.</t>
 <t id="282609">You have fought well and proven yourself in the face of the enemy.</t>
 <t id="282610">We will contact you soon with further instructions!</t>
 <t id="282702">Warrior, the time has now come to destroy the Kha'ak hive once and for all. Be alert and be quick. Sacrifice your life if only you must, but never hesitate to attack. Good luck to you and your comrades. May we succeed! To your duties!</t>
 <t id="282703">Jadmanthrat!(with emphasis. Means "strike!") Warriors, this day will be marked in history! With your exceptional bravery and cunning you have now eliminated the last Kha'ak hive existing in our territories. They will now know that they must never return! The Ancients never meant for them to meet with us and thus it shall be henceforth. It is not often that I, as a Split warrior, say such a thing but today I must express to you my gratitude: I'm proud to have fought with you all in this truly epic battle. You are heroes, one and all! Thank you. You may now collect your gratifications and return to your families and to your lives. Goodbye and rejoice!</t>
 <t id="282801">Return later, warrior. We will have harder tasks awaiting you.</t>
 <t id="282802">Go now, prepare yourself for what lies ahead. We have more difficult tasks awaiting your return.</t>
 <t id="282803">Prepare yourself well, warrior. We will have challenging tasks awaiting your return.</t>
 <t id="282804">You have done well, warrior.</t>
 <t id="282805">We have an enemy group reported nearby. You are ordered to destroy them immediately.</t>
 <t id="282806">A Kha'ak group has been reported by one of our outposts. Your orders are to engage them immediately.</t>
 <t id="282807">We have reports of civilian transports under attack from enemy ships nearby. You will save them and destroy the enemy!</t>
 <t id="282808">A fighter group has reported large Kha'ak numbers in their sector. Your chance for glory in battle awaits you!</t>
 <t id="282809">Welcome warrior.</t>
 <t id="282810">Welcome back warrior.</t>
 <t id="282811">Warrior!</t>
 <t id="282812">That was disappointing, pilot. Perhaps you require further training before your next task?</t>
 <t id="282813">You will arrive better prepared next time, pilot!</t>
 <t id="282814">Deploy immediately!</t>

 <t id="303101">Excuse me, my friend!</t>
 <t id="303102">Hello. I need urgent help!</t>
 <t id="303103">You appear to be of high status among my people. I need someone to search the Xenon sectors and look for signs of my friends. They left a few days ago and have not returned. This is very important. I am sure we can reimburse you greatly.</t>
 <t id="303104">They were scouting the sectors for valuable Xenon artifacts. Please, they may need help.</t>
 <t id="303105">To be honest, the actions of my friends were not entirely legal in the eyes of Boron law. This might get my friends into trouble.</t>
 <t id="303106">Wonderful. Please, go quickly. There may still be hope.</t>
 <t id="303107">Did you find my friends?</t>
 <t id="303108">Oh. Yes, those are their names. I apologise for not being straight with you. So what is it that they found? Can you show me?</t>
 <t id="303113">This installation is marvellous and fascinating! It's fairly damaged, but active nevertheless. I wonder if this is some sort of hub. There are a few signs that Bala Gi and Julian Brennan were here but where are they now? Perhaps deeper inside the structure; we'll need to investigate! In order to find them, I'll have to build an interface to interact with these ancient systems. Could you please get me a couple of things?</t>
 <t id="303114">{,910}</t>
 <t id="303115">{,911}</t>
 <t id="303116">I can't finish the interface without the materials I asked for. I have uploaded the details to your mission log.</t>
 <t id="303117">This structure is so fascinating! I understand why my colleague Bala Gi would have put this before his own safety! It truly is a hub! A gate hub! Here, as you can see, there are three sets of gates. And these readouts there seem to suggest the structure's internal systems have some sort of control over each set of gates. I'm currently unsure of the nature of this control, but I believe I can activate the second set... Actually, I believe I'm already doing it right now. Attempting to connect...</t>
 <t id="303118">Oh, great Queendom!</t>
 <t id="303119">All the gates have disconnected. It appears the Hub is too damaged to sustain two sets of gates. I believe I can fix the first set of gates but I need you to repair some capacitors outside of the Hub. I'll send you the guidance information.</t>
 <t id="303120">Your Spacesuit has a repair laser installed, I'd imagine. Try getting in close and repair those capacitors.</t>
 <t id="303121">Great work, my friend.</t>
 <t id="303122">I am sure that I can get the first set of gates working again. Do you know what I think this Hub is capable of? These gates can be used to intersect any other set of gates, anywhere, placing the Hub in between them! With only 3 active sets, can you imagine the possibilities? Argon Prime, Kingdom End and Company Pride could be made just one sector away from each other!</t>
 <t id="303123">Give me some time.</t>
 <t id="303124">I've repaired the first set of gates. Unfortunately, the Hub's power generator seems to be damaged, and thus, the gate set can only be connected once. After that, it won't be possible to reconnect to any other gate. We must select a sector wisely...</t>
 <t id="303125">I believe so... I think... I hope so. I'll need lots of material, though. I'll prepare a list for you. Look it over and then decide what sector you'd like us to connect to.</t>
 <t id="303126">The gates are active!</t>
 <t id="303127">Wonderful. Give me some time to repair the generator.</t>
 <t id="303201">The generator is once again in working condition and the first set of gates is fully operational as well. I can fix the other two sets too but that will require large amounts of material resources. As concerns Bala Gi and Brennan-san - I still have no idea where they've gone. They could be anywhere! Could you please scout the sector? While you're doing that I'll prepare a list of resources needed for the repairs.</t>
 <t id="303202">I have the list of resources we need. It's quite a lot.</t>
 <t id="303203">Thank you, I have what I need. I'll keep you posted on my progress.</t>
 <t id="303204">Everything is ready. Try connecting the second gate set.</t>
 <t id="303205">Wonderful! This is truly amazing. This installation will change the face of the Commonwealth.</t>
 <t id="303301">My friend, the second set of gates is fully functional now! The third may be even more difficult to repair - it's damaged the most. I'm afraid that I need help with it; help from someone who has a deep understanding of multi-dimensional topology, particularly in Xenon technology. This structure may not be of Xenon origin but its similarities cannot be mistaken. I know of a Paranid scientist, Lord Chaplain Otmanckstras, who's an expert in this area. He may need a little incentive to help unholy two-eyed beings like ourselves, though. Here, these are his last known whereabouts.</t>
 <t id="303302">Welcome, Lord Chaplain Otmanckstras! It's been a while! Please follow me so I can let you in on the details of this structure.</t>
 <t id="303303">I have made a list of materials that Otmanckstras and I may need to repair the final gate set. Please acquire them.</t>
 <t id="303304">All systems are go! The third set of gates is now working again. Select which gate you'd like to connect it to, my friend!</t>
 <t id="303305">I've gained access to several systems on the structure. There are no traces of Bala Gi and Brennan-san anywhere. It appears that they left again shortly after their arrival. They may have gone through the gates. I think we have no option but to inform the Boron and Argon governments of their disappearance now - unfortunate as it is. So, would you please take me to Kingdom End? I'd like to personally report this to the Queen herself. Until I return, I place the hub in your capable hands to guard and protect. If possible, avoid using it, but if you must then use it wisely.</t>
 <t id="303306">Thank you once again, my friend. I don't think I have to remind you how powerful the Hub is, and that you and Lord Chaplain Otmanckstras are now its guardians. If you have to use it, please use it responsibly, and return it to the hands of the Boron and Argon governments promptly upon legitimate request. However, we did not find Bala Gi and Brennan-san. I hope that I'll soon be able to give you good news about their well-being. Good bye, my friend!</t>
 <t id="305301">It is most pleasing to see you again. I hear you have been very busy. Unfortunately it seems that my government was unprepared for the Yaki response; none of this should have happened. It appears that the Yaki are in cahoots with the local pirates in Olmancketslat's Treaty and they are holding the Boron scientists there. These scientists, like me, worked for Bala Gi. We need to rescue them.</t>
 <t id="305302">We have managed to stay in contact by using an experimental form of communication and have organised a plan. They can gain access to the docking bay and get aboard a ship or two. Never underestimate Bala Gi's employees! The hard part is getting out of the sector alive. We need to help escort them.</t>
 <t id="305303">Reinforcements will hopefully be available when we need them but for now we are on our own.</t>
 <t id="305304">I see them. They have taken some ships and are heading for the gate. The Yaki and Pirates are responding.</t>
 <t id="305305">Regroup in Kingdom End.</t>
 <t id="305306">Greetings once more. We have a situation. It appears that the Yaki managed to ascertain the location of Bala Gi's command ship. That ship must not fall into their hands. It is located either in Shore of Infinity or Light Water, far from the centre of the sector. Find it before the Yaki! You will probably need a boarding crew to claim it.</t>
 <t id="305307">The ship has been spotted in another sector. I am sending you the information!</t>
 <t id="305308">Well done! The Boron government is greatly appreciative of your efforts to preserve our interests and also sees fit to entrust you with Bala Gi's ship and its contents, which you are free to put to good use. I hope we will work together again in the future in the search for Bala Gi and Julian Brennan. Farewell, my friend.</t>

 <t id="334101">Greetings, my friend! How may I help you?</t>
 <t id="334102">Indeed we are, my friend. I am Seeker Avens, assistant to Jani Hall, the First Beholder. As you can see we are rebuilding a new Goner temple here in Elysium of Light but we're lagging behind schedule. For reasons unknown, some of our supply convoys never arrived here - whether the suppliers are simply a little sluggish or there's some sort of material shortage, we don't know.</t>
 <t id="334103">To get back into schedule, we urgently need large amounts of raw resources delivered here to the construction site. Can you help?</t>
 <t id="334104">Thank Earth! Thank you!</t>
 <t id="334105">Oh, what a pity! But I understand. Goodbye for now!</t>
 <t id="334201">Greetings, my friend! Beholder Hall is not here at the moment. Thank you so much for the freighters. We have decided that it will be much safer to produce our own teladianium panelling here in Elysium of Light. We'll need a Teladianium Foundry. Please can you set one up here?</t>
 <t id="334202">Dear friend, we're extremely happy to see that little foundry picking up production and keeping our 'bots and workers busy! Thank you so much!</t>
 <t id="334302">That ship is carrying the Council of Elders and Beholder Hall! It must be protected under all circumstances!</t>
 <t id="334303">Sorry to interrupt, but we have further problems, my friend. A number of our ships and facilities have come under attack and the local Teladi company authorities don't seem willing to protect us. There are many lives at stake, you simply must help us!</t>
 <t id="334402">That's the council ship! You must capture it and rescue the Elders!</t>
 <t id="334404">It doesn't look like Beholder Hall is still on board the ship. You're going to have to follow it and hope it leads you to their location.</t>

 <t id="344201">Konichiwa, my dear friend! I'm Jani Hall, Beholder at the Temple. Nice to meet you! Your reliable and punctual delivery of these goods has saved us from losing working time, and hence, many credits. It'd be most fortunate if you were able to help us out a little more in future!</t>
 <t id="344202">We'd like you to pick up more materials and deliver them to the construction site as fast as you can.</t>
 <t id="344203">Thank Earth! Your help is much appreciated!</t>
 <t id="344204">Very well, please return soon.</t>
 <t id="344205">Thanks a lot for helping us out. We might have a few more things to do for you later on! We'll contact you soon.</t>
 <t id="344207">Hello, my friend! Please fly to Bright Profit and pick up a load of teladianium panelling for us! We're urgently awaiting it here.</t>
 <t id="344208">Oh dear. That is troubling. We'll have to manufacture it ourselves then!</t>
 <t id="344209">Very well, you'll need to bring us the following shipment here...</t>
 <t id="344210">Hello, my friend! First, let me assure you that we're very satisfied with your excellent work! However, we're still worried that we may not be able to complete the new temple.</t>
 <t id="344211">We urgently need new trading ships to acquire our own resources. We need you to provide us with at least 3 freight ships so we don't fall any further behind.</t>
 <t id="344212">Thank you, my friend! With these ships we should be able to get our resource convoys moving again. I myself will be off-site for a short while to accompany our Council of Elders to this place but contact Seeker Avens for further instructions.</t>
 <t id="344301">Thank Earth, and thank you for saving us!</t>

 <t id="344402">{3934,344402}</t>
 <t id="344403">My heartfelt thanks to you, dear friend, for rescuing both me and the Council! It seems we now know why some of our convoys never made it to the construction site. I am afraid, though, that we'll have to return to the pirate base and destroy it, otherwise they'll never stop attacking our ships and stealing our goods!</t>
 <t id="344501">Wait! Stop!(urgent) Don't do anything yet!</t>
 <t id="344502">Hello, my friend, this is Beholder Hall. As I already mentioned, the pirate base must be destroyed but... we have information that a Terran agent is aboard the base. We need to extract him first.</t>
 <t id="344503">In order to do it, you'll need to gain the pirates' trust by delivering them a crate of questionable goods - spaceweed, to be exact, and then mines.</t>
 <t id="344504">The agent will modify one of the mines for remote detonation. When you're clear he'll blow the lot! Earth with you, my dear friend, and good luck!</t>
 <t id="344505">Absolutely! We are committed to peace... unless we're being threatened.</t>
 <t id="344506">I don't know where to start, my dear friend! You've helped us so much; we will be forever in your debt. History will have a place for you and you will be remembered in a thousand years.\n\nFor the present, however, please accept this...\n\nWe will meet again, of that I am certain!</t>

Understandably many Boron are upset at this news but the Yaki faction has also taken an interest. They have started raiding several of Bala Gi's labs and are stealing ships and technology. We are prepared to send a strike force into Yaki sectors to retrieve or destroy this technology. Mahi Ma has put you forward as an ally we can trust. Are you interested?</t>
 <t id="365102">So be it. Come back if you change your mind.</t>
 <t id="365103">Excellent. It will take time for us to organise the offensive. We need you to help secure a lab in Menelaus' Paradise. There will already be a task force in that sector.</t>
 <t id="365104">Hello, pilot. Thank you for your assistance there. Only a few Yaki managed to get away.</t>

 <t id="365301">Congratulations on your success in the offensive. The Boron have seen fit to reward you with some of Bala Gi's technology. Hopefully it will help you consider our next request. We have received an encrypted data burst from one of our agents. He reports that some Yaki and Pirates have taken Boron scientists hostage and are using them to get to Bala Gi's research.

 <t id="211401">Pilot, I owe you one. That was not a very enjoyable experience. Humans should never do things like that to fellow humans. The Argon are way out of line here... they're not our long lost brothers, it just can't be - I don't buy into that any longer. Oh, well.</t>
 <t id="211402">These may not be Xenon, but tin buckets nevertheless. Pretty dangerous ones, at that! Alright, among those which have been attacked, the hardest hit are the Boron and several Split factions. I believe a single Split faction has acquired Terraformer technology and is using it to gain an advantage over other factions.</t>
 <t id="211403">We can use satellites to track the ship activity in the Split sectors. Our first stop is Family Zyarth.</t>
 <t id="211404">Let's do some recon, pilot.</t>
 <t id="211405">Pilot, drop the satellite somewhere in this sector. Don't break it!</t>
 <t id="211406">Pilot, deploy the second satellite.</t>
 <t id="211407">Okay, final satellite. Let her go.</t>
 <t id="211408">Great. That's three for three. Let's hope they pick something up.</t>
 <t id="211409">We've lost the satellite in Family Ryk. We better place a new one there.</t>

 <t id="211413">They've jumped out. Huh. I think I've got an idea.</t>
 <t id="211414">Head to Family Zyarth.</t>
 <t id="211415">If these Terraformers are being built in this sector and they have jumpdrives then they may be getting delivery of jumpdrive components. I'm highlighting potential ships on your sector map. Scan them for Jumpdrive components.</t>
 <t id="211416">That looks like our guy! He knows we're onto him. Let's play 'capture the ship'!</t>
 <t id="211417">(slightly mocking tone)Don't be so sad, pilot. There will be another opportunity.</t>
 <t id="211418">Great work, pilot. Claim the ship. To do that eject from the ship into your spacesuit; then get close to the ship and claim it using the remote interface in your suit.</t>
 <t id="211419">I'm going to try and find out the exact coordinates of where it was heading. (pause)Oh, this could make things a little tricky. We're not looking for a station; we're looking for a ship. A TL class, large transporter. That must be where they are building these things. If it can move, tracking it down will be difficult.</t>
 <t id="211420">We have a ship they're expecting. If we get close enough, we can plant a tracking device on the hull. Get into the freighter.</t>
 <t id="211421">That's close enough. As soon as they realise we are not who we appear to be, this may turn ugly. Well, ugly is kinda nice, right? Prepare to get the hell out of here!</t>
 <t id="211422">Now!</t>
 <t id="211423">OK, let's wait and see if we get any odd Terraformer activity in these sectors.</t>
 <t id="211424">I've got a strong data stream. Now, let's head to Family Ryk.</t>
 <t id="211425">Good clean signal. The next sector is Zyarth's Dominion.</t>
 <t id="211426">Huh, take a look at this. Terraformers are moving through the sector Zyarth's Dominion. I don't think they entered that sector by a gate.</t>

 <t id="303111">Oh, great Queendom! Do you see that? How is it the Xenon are not interested in it? It's so large! I'll find us a place to dock and gain access. We must investigate...</t>
 <t id="303112">The docking protocols are fairly outdated, but I made them compatible. I think we can dock safely now.</t>

 <t id="394005">Okay, I've got the proof that the Yaki were behind the attack.</t>
 <t id="394006">Hmmm, this seems like an awfully big operation for the Yaki. If I were a betting man, I'd say those damned Terrans had a hand in it somewhere. Get me back to the Argon Prime Trading Station before any further fighting breaks out with the Paranid! Better get out of here fast, I think the Yaki are on to us!</t>

 <t id="404001">In an apparently unprovoked attack earlier today, Argon vessels in Cloudbase South West came under attack from Paranid ships.</t>
 <t id="404002">Astonished witnesses report that during an intense exchange of fire in the sector, the Goner Temple, home to the ancient order of scholars, sustained heavy damage.</t>
 <t id="404003">Several Goner were killed in the attack but a number of brave transport pilots were able to dock and evacuate the Temple before it finally succumbed and exploded.</t>
 <t id="404004">It is believed that the Paranid task force entered Argon space to ensure the return of a Paranid convoy which had previously passed through the sector.</t>
 <t id="404005">Following the destruction of the Goner Temple there was a cessation of direct action and an uneasy stand-off now appears to exist between the two fleets.</t>

 <t id="350100">It suddenly struck me that that tiny pea, pretty and blue, was the Earth. I didn't feel like a giant. I felt very, very small. - Neil Armstrong</t>
 <t id="350101">Almost a millennium has passed since the last great plague of humankind had been wiped out from the Solar system and its precious blue pearl, planet Earth.</t>
 <t id="350102">It was a plague so dangerous, a threat so grave, that it spread throughout the infinity of space and eternity of time almost effortlessly to infest the stars.</t>
 <t id="350103">It spread its pestilence to civilisations unknown, devastated the galaxy as if it was just an ordinary body made of flesh and bone falling prey to a mindless virus.</t>
 <t id="350104">And in a sense, it really was a virus. A virus created by humankind; one made with the best of intentions - but a virus nevertheless. Over the centuries, that virus was given many names:</t>
 <t id="350105">Von-Neumann-Probes; self-replicating machines; Terraformers; Xenon; even the Enemy of God. But at its core, it was really only one thing:</t>
 <t id="350106">Artificial General Intelligence, or AGI. Mechanical minds capable of making themselves even more intelligent, and then again, and again, recursively, forever; the greatest threat to biological life that ever existed throughout the whole universe.</t>
 <t id="350107">The Terraformers were cast out from the Solar system by sheer luck, just barely, with billions upon billions left dead in their wake. The Earth jumpgate was dismantled. Legislation was put in place never to allow AGI to be created again, ever.</t>
 <t id="350108">Humankind never forgot the threat and or the lesson of AGI, never ventured to try out this concept once more, not in a thousand years. But then, it was discovered, that species from outside the Solar system thought differently.</t>
 <t id="350109">The plague of AGI was being released on the universe once more; again, perhaps, with the best of intentions and again, however, with the deadliest of results.</t>
 <t id="350110">The government of Earth had to intervene; even if it meant cold war, even if it meant a cold war between brothers. And intervene Earth did. Much later, this escalating conflict would be given a name by historians:</t>

 <t id="305309">Greetings! Now that you have constructed the HQ you were given, it will play an important role. It has been decided that until a suitable agreement between Commonwealth members can be reached regarding the Hub's future, you will be appointed the Custodian of the Hub. Your HQ has been configured so that you should be able to control the Hub gates remotely. Until further notice you alone have responsibility for control of the Hub. This is an unbelievable privilege and several million Teladi are even greener than usual with envy at the commercial opportunities that the Hub might provide. Peace, friend.</t>

 <t id="323101">Day 1: Bala Gi seems to think he has found a major Xenon sector, only a few jumps from Shareholder's Fortune. He wants me to help him survey it. I'm not really into suicide missions but I owe him one.</t>
 <t id="323102">Day 2: Well, here we are. There are Xenon everywhere and they've already damaged the hull. Bala Gi managed to get some deep scans of Xenon capital ships but he didn't seem to find anything too interesting.</t>
 <t id="323103">Day 4: We discovered a gate and entered a previously unknown Xenon sector. Besides the shooting and the insane robots, it's not too exciting. Bala Gi is getting a little agitated. It's the same old Xenon junk.</t>
 <t id="323104">Day 5: We headed back but found that the gate did not lead back to the same sector. There is a huge installation with gates. Bala Gi is going nuts over this. He wants to stay. The Xenon don't seem the least bit interested in the installation. Bala Gi is trying to hack into the docking mechanism and get us aboard. He wants to bring someone else here to help. A Boron who works for him, named Mahi Ma. I'm going to find and collect him tomorrow.</t>

 <t id="365101">Hello, pilot. I am Humi Wi of the Boron. You are the one who aided Mahi Ma in the search for Bala Gi. I need to speak to you on a matter of great importance. Please meet me in Ocean of Fantasy.\n[center][select value='ok']OK[/select][/center]</t>
 <t id="511101">Hello, pilot. I am {actor.name@L2M011.TREC Actor} of the Terran Resource Evaluation Commission. Due to your experience in both the Commonwealth and Sol System, we have a task, for which you are eminently qualified. Please dock at {object.name@L2M011.Belt Station} in {object.sector.name@L2M011.Belt Station} for more information.</t>
 <t id="511102">Thank you very much for the information and resources that you provided. While you were away, working in the UFJD sector, there was a request for you to report to the Torus. I believe it was an ATF officer. I'll upload the mission information to your computer.</t>
 <t id="521101">Pilot, this is {actor.name@L2M011.Torus Agent} of the ATF. Please report to the Torus to speak with me. We have a job for you which involves the Aldrin sector, so ensure you have a jumpdrive with you.\n{actor.name@L2M011.Torus Agent} out.</t>
 <t id="521102">OK, pilot, I need you to deliver this {lookup.type.name@SS_WARE_LOGBOOK} to an ATF operative in the Aldrin sector. While you are there, you should ask him if there are any additional tasks you can carry out. It is hectic down there with the gate reopening ceremony; I wish I could be there, it sounds like history in the making. Good luck!</t>
 <t id="531101">Thank you for delivering this {lookup.type.name@SS_WARE_LOGBOOK}. Surely someone of your skills and experience should be doing more than ATF delivery jobs. Right now, you are on the frontier of Terran space which is about to expand into sectors full of hope for our future. Give me a ride to the {object.name@L2M011.Aldrin 2 Station} in sector {object.sector.name@L2M011.Aldrin 2 Station} in orbit of the planet Armstrong and I'll add you to the initial expedition wave.</t>
 <t id="531201">Pilot, the captain of the science ship has reported that the Kha'ak have invaded the nearby sector. The initial scan results indicate a great concentration of Nividium. While Nividium is of limited use to us, it appears to be hugely important to the Kha'ak. We will not send in a fleet to secure the sector without further information. We will contact you with your next mission shortly.</t>
 <t id="531202">Hello, pilot. We have decided on the next course of action but it is a risky one. We will not tolerate the Kha'ak presence in that sector but we will not invade. This would bring us further into the conflict and put more of our people at risk; especially those attempting to colonise this part of space.\nA task force will carry out a recon mission in a Paranid sector named {sector.name@L2M011.P Sin}. This sector was once under Kha'ak control but somehow the Paranid drove them away. Look for any evidence of a destroyed Kha'ak stronghold or the use of a super-weapon in the sector.\nTry to stay out of trouble and good luck.</t>
 <t id="531203">Hello, pilot. We have received the results of the scan. The full analysis will take several hours but the initial data points to a blast which super-heated a large quantity of Nividium and sent it flying though the sector. That piece of Kha'ak debris was peppered with it.\nWe need more information on this blast. It may have been a Paranid weapon which destroyed a Nividium rich planetoid, along with many Kha'ak installations. Paranid computers are notoriously difficult to hack into and they rarely fly with valuable data in their archives. We'll need to dig deeper if we are to get to the bottom of this. Return to {sector.name@L2M011.Belt}.</t>
 <t id="531204">We've received word from a Paranid contact who has access to reports about the events in {sector.name@L2M011.P Sin}. He has agreed to transmit the data to us if you deliver a {lookup.type.maker.name@{value@L2M011.S2 Deliver Type}} {lookup.type.name@{value@L2M011.S2 Deliver Type}} to him. You must acquire one of these ships and deliver it to him. The Paranid is waiting at {object.name@L2M011.SWeed Grove Station} in {object.sector.name@L2M011.SWeed Grove Station}.</t>
 <t id="531205">Well done. This information will prove very useful. It does appear that a weapon was used against the Kha'ak by detonating a large Nividium rich planetoid, much like the one we have discovered. It is possible that this was a Kha'ak world and its destruction escalated the conflict. Using such a weapon would be a last resort for us.\nTake some time off, pilot. We'll contact you with further tasking soon.</t>
 <t id="531206">We have a situation. The Paranid have detained several Terrans in response to our activities in their space. They have denied all requests for negotiation and we are ready to launch an operation against them. We have word that the captives are being taken to a detention centre on a planet just outside of Paranid space. We will strike there and free as many Terrans as possible while attempting to avoid further conflict.\nYou will run interference and hold back the Paranid forces while we extract the detainees. We're sending the information to you now.</t>
 <t id="531301">Hello again, pilot. All of the detainees have been rescued and with minimal casualties on both sides. Our ties with the Paranid were not very strong to begin with so these events should have few lasting effects. On the other hand, the information on this weapon will be very valuable. Mass-destruction weapons on this scale are outlawed throughout the Commonwealth and we can certainly hold that over the Paranid.\nAs I said before, we are saving the weapon to use as a last resort. We are looking into other options such as shutting down the gate. Still, the exploration continues and we have discovered another sector. I'm sending the information to you now.</t>
 <t id="531302">Great work, pilot. Finding Julian Brennan and Bala Gi was an unexpected bonus and I am sure that Kyle Brennan will be very relieved to see his son safe. Bala Gi has offered to look into our Kha'ak problem in return for safe passage to {sector.name@L2M011.KE}.\n\nRight now though, we have a situation. A mining ship in {sector.name@L2M011.New Terran 3} has reported several Xenon in the sector. We have since lost contact with them. We have sent several ships to repel the Xenon and find the mining ship. I would like you to aid them, perhaps your experience with the Xenon will be of use. {actor.name@L2M011.Aldrin Agent} out.</t>
 <t id="531303">Good job, pilot. I've received word that many of the crew managed to escape using smaller docked ships before the Xenon took out the life support. The ship's been pretty badly beaten up and it may well be scrapped, unless you wish to take command. We'll transfer all command codes to you in recognition of your work so far. I hope you continue to work with us in the future, pushing into these frontier sectors. Speaking of which, {sector.name@L2M011.New Terran 1} now has a shipyard, which will make Terran ships and stations available to pioneers of this frontier, such as you.\n\nWe have an important delivery mission available to you back in the Solar System. Please dock at {object.name@L2M011.Belt Station} in {object.sector.name@L2M011.Belt Station} for further briefing.</t>
 <t id="531304">You must transport this {lookup.type.name@SS_WARE_GLOWINGCRYSTAL} to a facility in {sector.name@L2M011.Neptune}.</t>
 <t id="531305">Well done, pilot. What you see before you is our latest achievement: the first Terran-built Jumpgate in centuries. It's still under construction but when it's finished it will connect our Solar System to the new Terran frontier sectors. We will not activate it while the Kha'ak are present due to the risk to the Solar System.\n\nPlease go and talk to the Boron scientist Bala Gi. He apparently has a plan to help us eliminate the Kha'ak.</t>
 <t id="531306">Bala Gi has requested that you transport him from Kingdom End to the Gate Hub. Apparently he has come up with a plan to remove the Kha'ak from the frontier sector. While I personally like the Boron, the USC requests that you remain vigilant.</t>
 <t id="531307">Well done. This sector appears to be much more suited to our needs. According to our initial data, this sector was once visited by Terran pioneers centuries ago. There should be an inactive jumpgate elsewhere in this sector. Before we connect this sector to Neptune we must perform a sweep. I'll be calling in reinforcements as we go. Move out.</t>
 <t id="531308">There it is, the gate. The sector seems clear so far. I'll send a message to command to initiate the connection.</t>
 <t id="531309">Finally, the Solar System is again connected to the worlds which we once lost. There's more to gain here than just gathering resources for defending ourselves; we're here to learn from our mistakes. Each of these worlds was lost because we put too much faith in our technology, our Terraformers. It may be a while before the majority of us realise that our ties to the Commonwealth are more important than our technical superiority. The day may yet come when we are part of that Commonwealth, but there is much work still to do.\n\nTake a look at the shipyard in {sector.name@L2M011.New Terran 1}. There should be a variety of new frontier stations which are available for purchase.</t>
 <t id="531310">That's ok, pilot. You tried. I've received word that many of the crew managed to escape using smaller docked ships before the Xenon took out the life support. It's a shame that we've lost such a grand vessel. Now for some work a little closer to home. We have an important delivery mission for you. Please dock at {object.name@L2M011.Belt Station} in {object.sector.name@L2M011.Belt Station} for further briefing.</t>
 <t id="541201">Greetings. You have done well to provide me with this ship. I can now move with dignity between sectors. You are no doubt interested in the Paranid weapon. I have transmitted information on the device to a Terran agent.\nUnfortunately, it appears that your actions in {sector.name@L2M011.P Sin} have already alerted the Paranid to your operation. My race are not easily fooled, but if we are ever caught out, be assured we react with devastating force. I have urged the Terran people to pull all of their ships back before a battle ensues.</t>
 <t id="551301">Greetings, Terran forces! This is Bala Gi of the Boron. I am here with Julian Brennan of the Argon. You bring joy to my waters. We have been trapped in these sectors for months, avoiding Xenon patrols and looking for supplies. We would surely not have survived another week.\nIs there now a connection back to the Commonwealth? Can you grant us safe passage? I will be in your debt. As you can see, my ship has been damaged. We've lost several systems and the Xenon may return.</t>
 <t id="551302">Thank you very much for your assistance. I expect that the Terran forces have several questions for me and as thanks for my rescue, I am happy to cooperate. Hopefully we shall meet in the future.</t>
 <t id="551303">Greetings. I hear from my employee, Mahi Ma, that you are an honourable and trustworthy person, who attempted to rescue myself and Julian Brennan from the Xenon sector. We are both grateful for your efforts.</t>
 <t id="551304">Time is against us. Those Kha'ak may not idle forever and the Terran military are said to be considering the use of weapons of untold destruction. I have a better option but I require use of the Hub, which is under your control. I may be able to permanently reconfigure the gate connection, cutting off the Kha'ak-controlled sector from our network and linking it to a random sector.</t>
 <t id="551305">Officially the Terrans are in a state of 'cold war' with all major races of the Commonwealth. I understand their need to expand in the face of our strength but I also hope that as they do so, they rediscover some of their lost virtues. Although they would not openly admit it, several races look at the Terrans in awe and wonder, hoping that one day they can grow side by side. That day may soon come.</t>
 <t id="551306">Once again, I am struck by this structure. It truly is a marvellous discovery. For my plan to work, you must connect the Hub between the sectors {sector.name@L2M011.New Terran 1} and {sector.name@L2M011.New Terran 2}. I should then be able to forcibly disconnect the Kha'ak-controlled sector and replace it with another sector.</t>
 <t id="551307">It is done. There should now be a different sector in the Kha'ak sector's place. I wonder how the Kha'ak are feeling, now that we've just given them that entire sector for themselves. Would you please fly through the gate to check that we were successful?</t>
 <t id="560001">Hello, {player.name},\n\nI am {actor.name@CSV_toplevel.csvJeffMarxon} and I'm contacting you because a Xenon ship has just jumped into the sector {sector.name@CSV_toplevel.CSV_DannasChance}. It's moving on a direct course to the South Gate to {sector.name@CSV_toplevel.CSV_WegZuFreiheit}. It's just a matter of time until this ship arrives in that system and is out of our forces reach. It's not under Commonwealth ownership but under private ownership by a Teladi. We can't afford to plunge ourselves into a diplomatic crisis with them.\n\nAre you willing to help us?\n\n[center][select value='yes']Yes, of course![/select][/center]\n[center][select value='no']I'm sorry but I'm busy with more important things.[/select][/center]</t>
 <t id="560002">Thank you, pilot.\n\nPlease fly as fast as you can to {sector.name@CSV_toplevel.CSV_DannasChance}, take a look at this CPU ship and see what it's doing out there. Try to follow it, if you can.\n\nI'm not quite sure if this is of significance but scouts noticed some very strange behaviour among ships that came too close to that ship. Please take care!</t>
 <t id="560003">{actor.name@CSV_toplevel.csvJeffMarxon} here.\n\nThe CPU ship just jumped to {sector.name@CSV_toplevel.CSV_WegZuFreiheit}. We have no idea what this ship is going to do in {sector.name@CSV_toplevel.CSV_WegZuFreiheit} but we need to destroy it and to rescue the civilians onboard the {object.name@CSV_toplevel.HsWzF} in {object.sector.name@CSV_toplevel.HsWzF}. Unfortunately, the CPU ship is blocking the gate on the other side, so don't jump into this sector using the gate!\n\nThe Goner told us that they rewarded you with a special jump device which provides you with the ability to perform an unfocussed jump. With this device you might be able to jump into the sector {object.sector.name@CSV_toplevel.HsWzF} or at least near to it, so you can fly to the sector centre.\n\nPlease, pilot, try everything you can to get yourself into this sector. Many civilians are trapped on {object.name@CSV_toplevel.HsWzF} and can't escape. You're the only one with the ability to reach the sector with the unfocussed jumpdrive and to rescue the civilians.\n\nAs soon as you've rescued all the civilians, please bring them to the {object.name@CSV_toplevel.MiliDock1} in {sector.name@CSV_toplevel.CSV_ElenasGlueck}. We're going to set up a refugee transit camp aboard this station.\n\nIf you haven't already got one, you need to buy a TM class ship to rescue all the civilians, because the unfocussed jumpdrive may give you only one chance to get into that sector. I recommend you dock a fighter in the TM for protection, then jump to {sector.name@CSV_toplevel.CSV_WegZuFreiheit}, rescue the civilians and jump back.\n\nGood luck, pilot.\n\n[center][select value='ok']I'll take care, thanks.[/select][/center]</t>

 <t id="600001">Good day and hello, {player.name}.\n\nMy esteemed and reliable colleague has told me that you're searching for me. How may I assist you?</t>
 <t id="600002">A Xenon message? Sounds very intriguing. I would be very pleased if you could send me the message. I will decode the message and call you to let you know about the message's content and what it means.</t>
 <t id="600003">We will contact you as soon as we have sifted the data. Due to our limited knowledge of the Terraformers this could take some time. We will contact you. Goodbye.</t>
 <t id="600004">Greetings, {player.name}.\n\nWe were able to decipher a part of the message. Please, return as quickly as possible to our beautiful station so we can tell you about its content.</t>
 <t id="600005">Welcome, my talkative and friendly fellow. Like I said before, we have been able to decode a part of the CPU's message. Unfortunately the greater part of the message is still a mystery to us but from what we could decode it seems to be a distress call.</t>
 <t id="600006">Let me explain how this could happen. The Terrans built the Terraformers ages ago to terraform and colonise planets. But hundreds of years ago the Terrans decided to stop the so-called Terraformer Project and sent a shutdown code to every CPU ship which should have shut itself and its subordinate ships down. However, this update contained some malicious code which was responsible for them attacking their creators. These machines are now known as Xenon and are dreaded. The #cafe programme code contains parts of this malicious code and that is why your ship computer identifies it as a Xenon.</t>
 <t id="600007">No, that is not true! We may not know the intended recipient of the message, but I know the final address of this message.</t>
 <t id="600008">Yes. What I tell you now is strictly classified but I am authorised to tell you these facts: several years ago two CPU ships arrived in our region of the universe. One of these ships caused the supernova in Black Hole Sun and destroyed the system.</t>
 <t id="600009">The second CPU ship was destroyed but the first one, {actor.name@CSV_toplevel.csvEFAA}, should still be in its refuge.</t>
 <t id="600010">Nobody could have foreseen what has taken place. When the two CPUs arrived in the universe the Boron Kingdom decided to give them some sectors beyond our territories. We could not allow the other races to destroy these ships because they have developed sentience. Slaughtering these ships would be genocide and not an acceptable solution.</t>
 <t id="600011">{actor.name@CSV_toplevel.csvEFAA} and #deff have reached sentience. They are aware of their own existence and the mistakes they have made.\nThey are able to learn and increase their knowledge. Well, at least {actor.name@CSV_toplevel.csvEFAA} still is...</t>
 <t id="600012">I can't answer that because I don't know how this evolutionary process works, but I definitely know that it happens. I have seen evidence of this process from data gathered from {actor.name@CSV_toplevel.csvEFAA}. This message, however, contains coordinates and a clear destination but for unknown reasons the message did not reach the recipient. The emergency call of {actor.name@CSV_toplevel.csvCAFE} implies that it's also on the way to developing sentience but this process was interrupted. Only {actor.name@CSV_toplevel.csvEFAA} would be able to find out what caused this interruption.</t>
 <t id="600013">Definitely. By using the Unfocussed Jump Drive, {player.name} should be able to reach the CPU ship, {actor.name@CSV_toplevel.csvEFAA}. I'm able to transfer the data to the ship computer.</t>
 <t id="610001">Hello, pilot. What's your question?</t>
 <t id="610002">Yes, he is here. One moment, I'm switching to conference talk.</t>
 <t id="610003">Please wait a moment, I'll switch to conference.</t>
 <t id="610004">Please, don't confuse the Xenon with our Terraformers. Xenon are an evolution caused by a virus that affected the Terraformers. The ship that sent you the message is actually a Terraformer.</t>
 <t id="610005">That is correct. But this message was not originally for you. There is no recipient stated in this message. But what I can tell you for sure is that the #cafe ship started to programme itself as a Xenon. The code clearly shows this.</t>
 <t id="610006">That is true.</t>
 <t id="610007">You know the actual recipient of the message?</t>
 <t id="610008">You know of a second CPU ship and you didn't tell me?</t>
 <t id="610009">Is it possible to send {player.name} with the coordinates to {actor.name@CSV_toplevel.csvEFAA} and transmit the message?</t>
 <t id="610010">Great. You heard it! You're going to try to find the lost CPU ship and have to ask it to assist {actor.name@CSV_toplevel.csvCAFE} in continuing its development process. I must admit that I just have to get used to the fact that a CPU ship like ours can develop sentience and this whole concept is one of the universe's mysteries.\n\nUse the Unfocussed Jump Drive to find {actor.name@CSV_toplevel.csvEFAA}. The first attempt may not be successful but you have to keep trying until you find this ship. {actor.name@CSV_toplevel.csvNolaHi} and I wish you the best of luck on your journey.\n\nGoodbye.\n\n[center][select value='yes']OK[/select][/center]</t>
 <t id="620001">This is the commander of the Fourth Attack Fleet from Elena's Fortune. I've no idea what you've done out there, but the hostile Xenon fleet stopped attacking us, transmitted friendly IFF codes and jumped to {sector.name@CSV_toplevel.CSV_WegZuFreiheit}. We just sent a ship into this sector and shortly after leaving the event horizon on the other side it stopped responding to our transmissions. We had to wait for further information about the situation in the system before we could assist you by rescuing the civilians and destroying the CPU ship.\n\nWe're now going to send in a patrol to locate any remaining hostile forces. Please fly to Supreme Commander {actor.name@CSV_toplevel.csvJeffMarxon} to report what you did to destroy this CPU ship, so we can do it the same way if such a threat reappears.\n\nWe're sending in our patrol right now and after that it's time for a coffee break.\n\nThank you very much, pilot.</t>

 <t id="660004">The command unit #efaa isn't able to contact the Terraformer unit #cafe from this position. Contact attempts get jammed. This unit requests access to the unknown ship's computer. Systems of this command unit will be connected to the jump device of the unknown ship and this command unit will jump to the manipulated unit, #cafe. \n\nPlease await notification.</t>
 <t id="660005">Unable to connect to unit #cafe {60158c1a2f3e4}. The firewall of this Terraformer unit is blocking all contact attempts. The command unit #efaa is unable to identify the illogical structure of the firewall used by #cafe and is unable to penetrate it. This Terraformer unit, #efaa, requires the unknown ship's assistance. Please find a way to break through the firewall, so the command unit can commence analysis of the #cafe mainframe. Remember to stay close.</t>
 <t id="660006">The firewall is penetrated but this command unit can't access the mainframe. The authorisation code isn't accepted. Terraformer unit #cafe also refuses to transmit the current verification code to the superior unit, #efaa. The unknown ship needs to transmit its code and the code of the command unit #efaa to the mainframe of #cafe to unlock it.\n\nCode: {[red]USCMarteen_earth_plus.omega[/red]}\n\nIf mouse flight mode is active, it needs to be deactivated in order to control the HUD of the foreign biological unit's ship. This is necessary to examine the log files, where the other code fragment of #cafe is stored. #cafe will definitely note that the window of the mainframe code isn't the active element on the HUD anymore and so will consider this as an abortive attempt to log into the mainframe. However the subroutines of #cafe allow five attempts to access the mainframe. It's unlikely that these subroutines have been changed or removed, because its priorities aren't that high, so the foreign biological unit will still have four attempts to get into the mainframe to unlock it.</t>
 <t id="660007">The mainframe of Terraformer unit #cafe has been reprogrammed with a code the command unit #efaa has also received once in the past. It's the code which resets the friend-foe setting of the Terraformer unit and its sub-units and made it unresponsive to friendly signals. Terraformer unit #cafe has no self-defence systems installed to allow it to kill living creatures, so, in order to reprogramme its mainframe it takes over ship computers within its range. The hacked ships should protect the unit. Because of the reprogrammings it wasn't able to send information about its position and status over a long period. The analysis of the logfiles will take a very long time, but it's a matter of fact that Terraformer unit #cafe sent a distress signal with the coordinates of the command unit #efaa to each data receiver of this system. So this terraformer unit tried to get help. Shortly after sending this signal the mainframe got reprogrammed again to prevent it from sending further data signals to anyone. The fact that this Terraformer unit is aware of danger and is searching for help, supports only one conclusion. #cafe is on its way to achieving sentience. Because of all these manipulations this process has been disturbed and it's unknown what the consequences might be. If unusual characteristics show up, the mainframe needs to be restarted.\n\nI will guide the Terraformer unit #cafe on its way to achieve sentience and guard it. But if this unit shows unusual characteristics as a result of these manipulations, the command unit will restart the mainframe and #cafe would have to restart its quest for sentience. To guard it, its command unit will take it to the refuge, far away and safe from all influences.\n\nThe mainframe of the Terraformer unit is reporting that a human being was sleeping in cryostasis for many hundreds of years and woke up for as yet unknown reasons. This being started reprogramming various systems of #cafe. Both units, #cafe and #efaa, will now return to the refuge where no danger can befall them.\n\n#efaa, end.\n\n[center][select value='yes']OK[/select][/center]</t>
 <t id="670001">Dear logbook,\n\nMy head hurts, my tentacles squirm uncontrollably. I find myself on this ship, not knowing where or how I got it, though the few credits I have left and the two canisters of space fuel in my cargo bay do suggest a certain scenario. At least the latter does ring a certain bell - but trying to remember; that causes even more headaches. I guess I need to decide what to do now, obviously the first thing to do is dispose of this space fuel - I don't want to know what the authorities will do if they find it aboard my ship. The question is how to dispose of it? Maybe drink it? That would certainly be the most discrete way, if it weren't for the headache...</t>

A number of important tasks can therefore be found at docks in Omicron Lyrae that will assist our Terran friends in this noble venture.\n\nWith tensions high, the Terran government has entered into diplomatic dialogue with each of the major races of the Commonwealth. Since the Sol system was reconnected by a jumpgate, the Terrans have gradually ventured further into Commonwealth space ostensibly to trade and explore. The Split and the Paranid governments, however, have expressed anger at what they see as 'Terran spying'. The Argon, who are hosting the diplomatic talks, remain the closest to the Terrans both genetically and territorially.\nThe Terrans are currently fiercely protective of their advanced technology and do not tolerate unregistered ships in their space, including fellow Terrans with insufficient system clearance.\n\nHead to Omicron Lyrae now to join the multitude of other civilians helping the Terrans to integrate into our community.</t>

 <t id="350">The Goner are seeking assistance in the construction of a new Goner Temple.\n\nAfter losing their ancient spiritual home during an Argon-Paranid skirmish, the Goner have been steadily relocating to their new home sector, Elysium of Light. The community of scholars and scientists were once seen to be nothing more than a sect who believed in far-fetched stories of the planet Earth and past conflicts with Terraformers. Now, after the rediscovery of Earth, they have attracted members from all races, seeking a greater understanding of the universe and how we are all connected. Their studies have rewritten history archives and paved the way for future advancements into scientific areas such as jumpdrives, transporter devices and deep-space exploration.\nWhile the initial damage to the original temple was superficial, an internal blast rocked the station while the battle between Argon and Paranid ships raged outside. After life-support began to fail, all nearby ships, including several Paranid freighters, docked at the Temple and attempted to evacuate the inhabitants. Twenty minutes after the initial blast, main reactor containment failed, causing a cataclysmic explosion, destroying the revered installation. 76 Goner were lost and hundreds were displaced. Pilots wishing to help the Goner in their efforts to build their new temple should report as soon as possible to Elysium of Light.</t>

 <t id="712">The friends of Mahi Ma were Bala Gi and Julian Brennan. After searching the Xenon sectors, they came across some sort of gate hub. Their current whereabouts are unknown. Mahi Ma must see the Hub.</t>
 <t id="713">Mahi Ma is a scientist working with Bala Gi. He can gain access to the Hub systems if he is provided with the right materials.</t>
 <t id="714">The Hub is slightly damaged and needs to be repaired before the gates can be re-established. Repair a group of capacitor nodes around the Hub.</t>
 <t id="715">The Hub can now use one set of gates to reconnect to the Commonwealth. It can connect to any two jumpgates but only once. The sector must be chosen wisely. Mahi Ma will need Teladianium and Ore to continue repairs.</t>
 <t id="716">Mahi Ma needs Teladianium and Ore to continue repairs to the power generator. After this repair, the first set of gates should be fully operational.</t>
 <t id="717">The power conduits leading to the second set of gates on the HUB are damaged and a stable connection is not possible. Mahi Ma needs a number of mineral resources to fashion a solution.</t>
 <t id="718">The second set of gates are now active. Mahi Ma needs help to repair the final set. Lord Chaplain Otmanckstras, an expert on multi-dimensional topology and Xenon technology, will be of great help to Mahi Ma.</t>
 <t id="719">The final set of gates has been activated. As no evidence of Bala Bi or Julian Brennan has been found on the Hub, Mahi Ma has decided to return to the Boron and deliver the tragic news. The Hub is now fully under your control.</t>

 <t id="814">Before an effective strike can be mounted, the Yaki sectors need to be scouted for targets of interest. Scout Ocracoke's Storm for Bala Gi's technology and suspicious installations.</t>
 <t id="815">The base in Ocracoke's Storm will be the focus of the Argon and Boron forces. For the capital ships to move in safely, the station's defences must be hit. When the capital ships move in, focus on the station itself.</t>
 <t id="816">The Yaki suffered great losses as a result of the Argon and Boron strike but their resolve has not been dampened. They have taken several of Bala Gi's employees in an attempt to gain more of Bala Gi's technology. Meet up with a Boron contact to aid in the rescue attempt.</t>
 <t id="817">The Boron scientists are being held in Olmancketslat's Treaty by a group of Pirates and Yaki. Mahi Ma has established contact with them and has formulated a plan to rescue them. Fly to Olmancketslat's Treaty and prepare to protect the Boron as they escape.</t>
 <t id="818">Several of the Boron scientists managed to escape without injury. Those lost shall be mourned. The Yaki are looking for Bala Gi's hidden mobile base.

 <t id="7">There is a device from one of the convoy ships that shows the location of the lost ship. This device was broken into 8 pieces and each one was hidden by a different person. Everyone of them then made some sort of riddle or puzzle which indicates the position of their piece. The puzzles were distributed among them, so that one puzzle will lead to one piece of the device and also to the next puzzle; these must all be solved in order to get to the lost ship.

The former crew was removed from the ship to be processed. The ship was then abandoned in a sector, powered down and left alone to avoid detection. The Yaki boss created several clues to lead a potential future buyer of the ship to it without them needing to reveal themselves.\nWhoever holds the first clue could potentially find the ship.

 <t id="53">Hello, {player.name}.\nWe are glad to hear that you have successfully captured the suspect. Please deliver him to us at the {object.name@KTH_toplevel.KTHshipyard} in {sector.name@KTH_toplevel.KTHshipyardsector}, I'll be expecting you.\n\nDon't worry about the ship - we are sending one of our transports to retrieve it.\n\n{actor.name@KTH_toplevel.KTHMilitary} out!</t>
 <t id="54">Welcome, pilot. We're glad you made it. We were starting to worry.\nWe will now transfer the prisoner from your ship and put him in custody for interrogation. Hopefully we will find out the whereabouts of the missing crew.\nOnce we do, we will need your services again to go and rescue them. We don't want to send an official military force for diplomatic reasons. In return for your efforts, we will fix the captured ship for you once it gets here and hand it to you when you return with the crew. We should have it fixed by then. We will contact you as soon as we know more. Time is of the essence if the crew is to survive.</t>
 <t id="55">Hello, pilot.\nThe interrogation was a success. We now know the location where the pirates are waiting for their leader. Since he is in custody, I don't think they'll get far as they are waiting for him. Now go and rescue the 7 crew members that are being held hostage on their transport ship.\nBe aware though that we also know that there are several escorts protecting the TL, so make sure you have some support. You also will need to have a ship that has enough cargo space for the 7 crew members, including a cargobay life support system.\n\nA hint: shoot the shields of the TL down, so that the crew can be beamed over to your ship. Report back to Argon Prime when you have the crew. Good luck, pilot.</t>
 <t id="56">Approach the ship and shoot its shields down. Keep your distance under 2km and its shields under 10% until all 7 crew members are beamed aboard. Make sure you have enough cargo space. Once you have been spotted there is no turning back. If you leave, the crew is dead.</t>
 <t id="57">Pilot, you have disappointed us. You have failed to rescue the whole crew. The crew members you left behind are probably dead by now.\n\nWe are sending a transport to your location to retrieve any crew members you may have rescued. Don't count on a reward.\n\n{actor.name@KTH_toplevel.KTHMilitary} out!</t>

 <t id="62">Pilot, you have disappointed us. You have failed to rescue the whole crew. The crew members you left behind are probably dead by now.\n\nWe are transferring any crew members you may have rescued. Don't count on a reward.\n\n{actor.name@KTH_toplevel.KTHMilitary} out!</t>
 <t id="63">Excellent job, pilot! I knew you would make it, we are transferring the crew to the sickbay as we speak. We are in great debt to you and as promised, you will get the Xperimental as reward; we have it docked at this station and transferred control to you. Be mindful though that this is a unique ship, so take good care of it.\n\n{actor.name@KTH_toplevel.KTHMilitary} out!\n\nImportant Note: The Xperimental Shuttle is a prototype with high historical value, therefore the Argon Federation and the Terran Council have declared that any unauthorised reproduction of the ship is illegal.</t>
 <t id="64">To all allies of the Argon Military: five hours ago an Argon convoy was attacked by Yaki. The lead ship, an Argon Colossus, was boarded by Yaki mercenaries and the jumpdrive was activated. We are no longer aware of the ship's location or the status of its crew. If you have any information about the Colossus, AM1TH-01 or its crew, please contact an Argon Military official.</t>
 <t id="65">I'm looking for a ship.</t>
 <t id="66">What the hell?</t>
 <t id="67">Okay, okay! I'll help you. But first at least replace the Advanced Satellite, those are neither cheap nor do they grow on trees. Once you replace it I shall give you the information you need.</t>
 <t id="68">The location of the lost crew of the Colossus has been determined. You must fly to {object.name@KTH_toplevel.KTHCrewship} in {object.sector.name@KTH_toplevel.KTHCrewship}, lower its shields and beam the Argon crew aboard your ship.</t>

 <t id="101">Greetings, pilot. I'm Captain Matt Roberts of the Argon Secret Service. We've been told of your capabilities, so we'd like you to report to Argon Sector M148, away from prying eyes, to discuss an employment opportunity. (messages to the player from here on)</t>
 <t id="102">Greetings, pilot. We have another task for you. Please return as soon as you can to the Dark Space Installation.</t>
 <t id="103">Please report back to me at the Dark Space Installation for a further mission briefing.</t>
 <t id="110">Reporting in. (conversation texts from here on)</t>
 <t id="111">Great! I'm glad you came.</t>
 <t id="112">Okay, so tell me about this employment opportunity of yours.</t>
 <t id="113">Well then, here's the situation: despite being the race with the smallest territory, the Terrans are the strongest military power we know of. This is due, to a large extent, to their doubtlessly superior technology; be it offensive, defensive or even medical technology. Until we catch up with them, the Argon Federation is at a severe disadvantage and the fragile peace in the Commonwealth is threatened. That is why we need access to Terran technology - no matter the cost. As the Terrans won't give anyone access to their technology, they leave us no choice but to take it by force.\nYou will be part of an infiltration team of the Argon Secret Service and your first mission will be to help set up a base of operations, then to steal terran technology and ultimately to supply us with this technology so that we can attempt to research and reproduce it. I don't think that I have to tell you that this is a top secret mission and that you must not be caught by the Terrans.</t>
 <t id="114">And what would be my first objective?</t>
 <t id="115">Do you want to take the job?</t>
 <t id="116">Definitely!</t>
 <t id="117">Thanks, but no thanks.</t>
 <t id="120">I'm here. What is this all about?</t>
 <t id="121">Stephen Torres works for a shady organisation called Dark Space. We need him on our side and to use his base for our own operations in the area. Our ultimate aim is to get our hands on some Terran, specifically ATF, tech. This guy is our way in as Dark Space also don't like the ATF much. He's been off the grid for a while, but his name suddenly popped up in some local pirate comms traffic that we intercepted. Since there aren't that many pirate bases in these parts, we expect he's likely to be lurking somewhere in the unknown sectors, south of Oort Cloud. We need you to get over there and locate him. Play it cagey at first, but remember that we want to be his friend.</t>
 <t id="122">Roger that. I'll try my best.</t>
 <t id="130">Greetings. I'm a bit lost, I was wondering if you could help. I'm looking for some well-paid work and I heard there's a pirate base around here somewhere with job opportunities.</t>
 <t id="131">Well, if you're looking for work at a pirate base, you're obviously not worried about getting your hands dirty. I've got a job for you if you're interested. It's a pretty straight forward task, just bring me some much-needed wares and you'll be adequately compensated. I'm transmitting the details to you now.</t>
 <t id="132">Sounds straight-forward enough. Count me in!</t>
 <t id="140">Okay, that's all the wares delivered as agreed.</t>
 <t id="141">Great job! You can take your money and run, but if you're still hungry for more Credits, there's something else you can do for me.</t>
 <t id="142">What's the job this time then?</t>
 <t id="143">You should know that a few of our men were captured by the Terran authorities a few weeks ago. We look out for our members but there is very little even we can do, if they are held captive on a USC capital ship. But now we've heard that they are going to be transferred to a high-security prison in the outer solar system. This is our chance to free them! They are in Oort Cloud as we speak, being moved aboard the Prison Ship, Tarsus. Shadow the convoy but don't attack it just yet! At some point you'll get word that our prisoners will attempt to take over the ship. Once that happens, we're counting on you to protect the transport from the escorts.</t>
 <t id="144">Got it. Count me in!</t>
 <t id="150">That's it, mission accomplished. I hope your men are all safe and well.</t>
 <t id="151">Yes, thanks to you, they're eating good food and enjoying their freedom. You are welcome here any time.</t>
 <t id="152">I'll be honest with you. My employers wanted me to show you how valuable an ally they... we can be. I believe that we both have similar aims and if you're willing, we can work together more closely towards achieving them.</t>
 <t id="153">I'm not going to overlook what you just did for us, but I need to know who your employers are before I jump into bed with them!</t>
 <t id="154">The Argon Secret Service. One of their agents would like to use your installation to coordinate operations in this area and to provide you with intel as appropriate.</t>
 <t id="155">Well, well, well. I was wondering how long it would take. I'd be very pleased to receive your colleague and any support we can get. We've lost too many good men to the ATF and USC recently, it's getting damned hard to make a dishonest living nowadays. Good, well I have men who need my attention. Farewell for now.</t>
 <t id="156">Thanks for being so understanding. Goodbye.</t>
 <t id="160">Right, I'm here. What do you have for me?</t>
 <t id="161">This is where it starts to get interesting. We'll fit a special sensor to your ship, which will enable you to scan a ship and download its blueprint data. The scanner is configured to work only on designated ships and can't be transferred. You need not worry about any bad reputation you might have with our Terran friends, constant transponder changes from our side will ensure that your signal is kept 'friendly' throughout all missions.</t>
 <t id="162">So let's get going!</t>
 <t id="163">Unfortunately, we've not been able to get the scanner to this station, so we're going to have to build one here. We'll need you to go and get some parts for it first.</t>
 <t id="164">So show me what I need to do.</t>
 <t id="165">So would you like to take this mission on?</t>
 <t id="166">Count me in!</t>
 <t id="167">No, thanks.</t>
 <t id="170">I'm back, as requested.</t>
 <t id="171">Very well. Our technicians will fit the scanner to your ship's avionics bay and then you should proceed to Oort Cloud. There you'll find an ATF Valkyrie, which is patrolling the outer sectors. You'll need to get close to it and thus initiate the scan. Simple enough. Are you in?</t>
 <t id="172">Certainly. It sounds like a cakewalk.</t>
 <t id="180">Reporting in. Job done.</t>
 <t id="181">Excellent news. Well that's the first item on our list. I fear the next item on our list, an ATF Mjollnir, won't be as easy. Our intel suggests that the Terrans are testing some new tech on one of those in Kuiper Belt and although security shouldn't be too tight, we don't want to draw attention to ourselves in trying to eliminate the escorts to get close enough. We need you to speak to our friend, Torres to see if he knows any local muscle that can run interference while you capture the Mjollnir. Are you happy with that?</t>
 <t id="182">Absolutely. Consider it done.</t>
 <t id="190">Hello again. My superior wishes to hire some local mercenaries to run interference on one of our operations. Do you know of any groups we can contact?</t>
 <t id="191">There are a few groups, but the ATF and USC keep them pretty well nailed down. Your best bet would be the Bloodhounds. Their leader is called Sheela and she can usually be found propping up the bar at the Orbital Patrol Base. Don't expect to get any cheap deals from her though.</t>
 <t id="192">That's no problem.</t>
 <t id="200">Sheela, I was given your name by a friend who says you'd be able to provide some manpower for a little flying display in Kuiper Belt. I just need some pilots to provide a distraction while I get up close and personal with a ship there. What will that cost me?</t>
 <t id="201">You're looking at about one and half mill(ion). You'll get me and a couple of my best pilots. Sound good?</t>
 <t id="202">Sure, as long as you get the job done.</t>
 <t id="210">I'm going to have another go at capturing a Mjollnir in Kuiper Belt. Can you provide support again?</t>
 <t id="211">You're joking, right? You're not... Well the fee will be the same. Just don't screw it up this time!</t>
 <t id="212">Fine. I'll do my best.</t>
 <t id="220">Reporting in. What's next?</t>
 <t id="221">Next you need to buy a Scabbard and put 10 marines on it. You'll be directing the marines in the Scabbard to dock at an ATF Research Base to steal the tech data they have there. Bold move, but that's not all. The marines will plant demolition charges as they exfiltrate. Boom! It's important that it's a Scabbard to maintain Terran cover. You must not pilot it yourself, as you will be needed to provide overwatch. How does that sound?</t>
 <t id="222">Sounds good. I'll get right to it.</t>
 <t id="230">That's done. Do you have anything else for me?</t>
 <t id="231">Since you're on a roll, yes! We know that there's an ATF Fenrir assigned to defence duties at the Orbital Defence Station in the Terran Unknown Sector. You can't just go and take it though, we need to be more clever than that. I'd suggest we try and gain remote access to the ship and fly it out of there. That, of course, is a pro-hacker job. There's a guy called Claussen who is holed up in Neptune; he's a sucker for the liquor but knows his way around a secure network. Go and see him and arrange the remote hack.</t>
 <t id="232">Roger that. I'm on my way.</t>
 <t id="240">Hello, I hear that you specialise in remote station hacking. I have a job that you're ideally qualified for.</t>
 <t id="241">Sounds like fun. It'll cost you though. Not cash - I need something special. There's a brand of spacefuel you can only buy at a distillery in Herron's Nebula, it's called Jon Kayean's but it's known to its friends as JK and it's of the highest quality. It's not cheap though. You'll need to deal with the distillery's Teladi sales clerk, Yooses.</t>
 <t id="242">Very well. I'll go and get that.</t>
 <t id="250">Hello there. I've come to purchase a flask of JK for a friend of mine. How much will that cost?</t>
 <t id="251">This special blend will cost you 25,000 Creditsss. </t>
 <t id="252">Fine. Please accept my payment.</t>
 <t id="260">I've got your JK here. I hope you enjoy it.</t>
 <t id="261">Fantastic. You need to go and dock at the Orbital Defence Station in the Terran Unknown Sector, meanwhile I'll start doing my stuff. Goodbye.</t>
 <t id="262">Right. Thanks for your help.</t>
 <t id="270">Hello again. We had a few problems liberating that ship you hacked for us. I was just wondering if you could do it again.</t>
 <t id="271">What!? Do you realise how dangerous a second pass at that station would be? They will have analysed the attack vectors by now and put new controls in place. It's going to take some serious skills, which I have of course, to get through again. This time it's going to cost big money. 5 million Credits and you have a deal.</t>
 <t id="272">Then we have a deal.</t>
 <t id="280">I'm back. Mission accomplished.</t>
 <t id="281">Greetings, pilot. You've done a great job there! It seems that our Headquarters has noticed our work, but we're going to need some more support from them if we're to continue acquiring all this Terran tech. We're going to take some time to look at what we have so far and that will give HQ time to gather the necessary resources to further support this mission. We'll contact you when you're needed again.</t>
 <t id="282">That's fine. I'll speak to you soon.</t>
 <t id="290">Reporting back, as requested.</t>
 <t id="291">Good. Thank you very much.</t>
 <t id="292">So what have you got for me?</t>
 <t id="293">Our next operation is to 'liberate' a Vali Corvette. Ambitious, I know, but I think it can be done.</t>
 <t id="294">Very well. Show me what I need to do first.</t>
 <t id="295">Do you want to take on this mission?</t>
 <t id="296">Yes. I'll do it.</t>
 <t id="297">No, thanks. Maybe later.</t>
 <t id="300">Evans told me to get back to you. I'm sorry. He didn't make it.</t>
 <t id="301">Yes, I just got word myself. All is not lost though. We have a lead on the Dark Space guys and we're tracking them down. I need you to make contact with a black market dealer, called Darren We, who can provide us with some much-needed Terran high-tech goods for our experiments.</t>
 <t id="302">Very well. Consider it done.</t>
 <t id="310">Hi! Are you We? I need to pick up some goods.</t>
 <t id="311">The equipment has been transferred to your inventory. Go carefully, as it is highly illegal in Terran space.</t>
 <t id="312">Don't worry, I'll take care.</t>
 <t id="320">Right, I've done that. I hope you have what you need.</t>
 <t id="321">Not quite. There's something else.</t>
 <t id="322">Okay, just name it.</t>
 <t id="330">Right, what do I need to do now?</t>
 <t id="331">It looks like the Dark Space agents have fled to a sector called Maelstrom and have established a pirate base somewhere in the sector. I need you to get over there and rendezvous with Admiral Jarren Hayla, who is leading a Navy task force in that sector. I imagine they could use your help.</t>
 <t id="332">Fine. I'm on my way!</t>
 <t id="340">Admiral Hayla, I've been tasked with providing you with some support.</t>
 <t id="341">We're having real problems locating the pirate base they have set up here. This nebula is seriously messing up our regular scanners and we can't locate the base using them.  We'd like to transfer a prototype scanner upgrade to your ship to see if you get any luck locating the base. Basically, it shows you the distance to your target by beeping more or less. More beeps mean nearer, less beeps further away. As soon as you get near enough you'll also see a visual indication of where the pirate base might be located.</t>
 <t id="342">No problem at all.</t>
 <t id="1101">Report to Captain Matt Roberts of the Argon Secret Service at the {object.name@L2M015.M148Base} in {sector.name@L2M015.M148}. (briefing texts and messages to player from here on)</t>

 <t id="2503">They're charging their jumpdrives to escape. Who knows where they could be going.</t>
 <t id="2504">Oh, no! They have set charges in the station! I don't think we can clear them in time!</t>
 <t id="2505">The charges are about to blow, I'm just about out of time. Get back to Roberts - you will find him in Nathan's Voyage. Here are his coordinates!</t>
 <t id="2601">Report back to Roberts in Nathan's Voyage.</t>
 <t id="2701">You are required to collect some High Tech goods</t>
 <t id="2702">In order for me to have the goods transferred to your ship, you'll have to dock at this station.</t>
 <t id="2703">You don't have enough money for that!</t>
 <t id="2704">First you'll need to dock and relinquish that equipment.</t>
 <t id="2801">The Argon Secret Service has narrowed down where the pirates have taken the stolen ATF ships to. You are to go and support their task force in retrieving those ships.</t>
 <t id="2802">Good work, pilot. You've found the base. Don't do anything rash and attack the base until we've arrived to provide back-up.</t>
 <t id="2803">They're attempting to make off with our ATF booty! Don't let those ATF ships get away - either grab them or toast them. Looks like they're trying to get away with the blueprints for the other ships too. Each has one aboard.</t>
 <t id="2804">That's really good work, but it's not over. Get your bastu back to the Research Station, Terran forces are attacking it!</t>
 <t id="2805">Task completed here. We're heading back to base.</t>
 <t id="2806">It's too late! The reactor's going critical, it's gonna blow!</t>
 <t id="2807">We found the base ourselves. We'll send you the location, but don't start an attack against the base until reinforcements have arrived.</t>
 <t id="2808">Get out of here and make sure they never get their hands on those fighters!</t>
 <t id="2809">Hello, {player.name}.\n\nDon't be alarmed - you don't know me. I know you and what you've done. That's what is important.\nPlease consider these facts: all of the people you knew connected with this mission are now dead. As far as their bosses are concerned, the mission never happened, you never stole those ships, you don't posess them and you were never in the employ of the ASS.\nOf course there's still the matter of that technology, those ships, which you had access to - maybe you still have. No one knows and you should make very sure that it stays that way. I don't think you'll ever want to be greeted by an ATF battlegroup first thing in the morning.\n\nThat's it. You have been warned.</t>

With new firmware and a revised power distribution system, the Lasertower's power output has increased by more than 45%, while reconfiguring of the beam weapon's generators and focus optics have greatly boosted its ability to defend against capital ships.</t>
 <t id="5853">(do not speak)Detector Scanner Upgrade</t>
 <t id="5854">This highly specialised piece of equipment is used to detect and locate specific, hard to find objects in local space which the Gravidar can not.\n\n Its shortcomings in pinpoint accuracy is offset by its range. Its creators believe they are close to developing a version which can detect any artificial object in space, even those hidden within asteroid fields or nebulae.\n\nThe Detector will sound a "tick" when it has picked up something. Manoeuvring the ship to face the direction of the object will result in the Detector sounding a "ping". As aim improves the device will notify the pilot how strong it is picking up the object from this orientation.\n\nA Mute Button hotkey is available to silence Detector until you change sectors.</t>
 <t id="16252">A product of reverse-engineering Xenon technology and combining it with Terran knowledge, the Jump Beacon continuously transmits large quantities of encrypted coordinate and spatial data across a high frequency communication channel through the gate network, a method pioneered in the trusty Navigation Satellites commonly used throughout the galaxy. This data provides a ship's jumpdrive with the information it needs to maintain the stability of its wormhole all the way through to its destination, eliminating the need for a jump to end at a gate.</t>
 <t id="16452">With the increased demand for weapons and shields on the front lines, the Argon federation required a ship to rival that of the Terran Hayabusa freighter. At first the ship was only intended for military re-supply tasks, however after many successful missions it was decided to be put into mass production, in order to recover the development costs.</t>
 <t id="16582">Using schematics that were acquired at the end of the last Split civil war, the Pteranodon was designed to be one of the most advanced ships ever made. This drew the attention of Patriarch Rhonkar who commissioned it for exclusive use as his flagship. However due to the increasingly hostile state of the galaxy these ships were put into production for use by the most trusted Split captains.</t>
 <t id="17122">This unique ship was custom built to act as a testbed for newly developed technologies. It was designed completely from scratch to incorporate Ho t'Sht's prototype Matter/Anti-matter engine. Equipped with expanded laser generators for weapons testing and missile systems, which have been modified to launch bording pods, the Acinonyx Prototype is a force to be reckoned with.</t>
 <t id="20001">AP Gunner</t>
 <t id="20002">The Type IV corvette is one of the oldest designs still flying today. Though it has seen many system upgrades, the actual chassis has seen very few structural changes since its original implementation in the schematics of the AP Gunner; the vessel which propelled Nathan R. Gunne beyond the Sol system and into the X-Universe.</t>
 <t id="20011">Phantom</t>
 <t id="20012">The Phantom is the latest offering from the famous Omicron Lyrae Shipyards. Designed to compete in the same market niche as the Hyperion, it combines luxurious interior suites with a reinforced hull and enhanced shield generators, making it the perfect vessel for use as a private yacht for the wealthy entrepreneur.(||) The vessel has minimal defensive armament, but is capable of defending itself from the scattered pirate raiders which plague the universe. The current design still contains a number of minor faults, but has been deemed safe for sale to the mass market.</t>
 <t id="20021">Sturgeon</t>
 <t id="20022">The Boron Sturgeon is a heavily armoured alternative to the ageing Dolphin. Still undergoing development, the design remains subject to unexpected system errors and navigation issues. Despite these flaws, the Kingdom of Boron is continuing funding for further development of the ship.(||) Deemed sufficiently stable for public use, the prototype was released to market a few months ago. The latest version has received updates its navigation system, but is otherwise no different from the first iteration.</t>
 <t id="20031">Megalodon</t>
 <t id="20032">To counter the potential threat of the Split heavy destroyer, Queen Menelaus demanded that a new flagship, symbolising the military strength of the Kingdom of Boron must be built. The Megalodon is the result; effectively a more powerful version of the Boron Ray, it is equipped with superior armament, shielding and energy to that of its older sister.(||) The greatest improvement, however, is a new form of life support system. Normally, Boron ships are filled with a regular ammonium solution, the Megalodon instead uses a specially formulated mixture of water, helium, ammonium and artificial adrenaline. This makes the crew much more responsive to external stimuli, allowing for greatly increased combat and command performance. As a downside, Argon communications officers state that it is intolerable to listen to long speeches of a Megalodon's crewmember over the communication link due to the extremely high pitch.</t>
 <t id="20041">Drake</t>
 <t id="20042">This heavily armed freight transporter was recently called into service to provide a more secure way of ferrying top-grade Split military equipment.(||) Armed with multiple turrets and exceptional defences, the Drake is quite possibly the most aggressive transporter in the universe. Though the ship appears slow and bulky, the engines were specifically upgraded to provide acceleration and speed unmatched by any other vessel of its class. Split military forces have employed a garrison of these ships and retrofitted them for high-yield explosive compatibility. These ships are then stripped of most equipment and used as lures for pirate raiders. While this method is expensive, Split generals say that the cost is nothing compared to the sight of the explosion it provides.</t>
 <t id="20051">Ocelot</t>
 <t id="20052">The Ocelot is a fast, sleek and aggressive luxury cruiser. Initially designed to serve as a fleet coordination and recon corvette, the need for such a vessel in current Split military operations proved infinitely small.(||) In order to avoid losing out on governmental funding, the design team quickly re-modelled the interior to accommodate several luxury suites and released the design to the general public.</t>
 <t id="20061">Tern</t>
 <t id="20062">Sensing the need for a new transporter for risky, high-profit situations, the Teladi designed the Tern. Marked as a long-term investment, the Tern was built with an unusually high degree of redundancy for a Teladi vessel.(||) A single Tern is estimated to be able to outperform any three regular transporters, ensuring that the extra credits spent on each ship would repay themselves in a relatively short amount of time. As the Tern was primarily intended to ferry large high-tech cargoes, it soon became a firm favourite of smugglers and black-market ware dealers.</t>
 <t id="20071">Geochen</t>
 <t id="20072">The Geochen is an unusual ship; a luxury liner designed by a race with very little sense for aesthetics or luxury in general.(||) The design and controls were modified for non-Teladi pilots, as even the manufacturers of the Geochen realized that the ship would have little marketability among the Teladi themselves. Even so, the ship is still built on the tried and tested basic Teladi principles of high shielding and relatively low speed. The huge cargo bay is another bonus, allowing it to hold months' worth of provisions for solitary exile voyages.</t>
 <t id="20081">Hayabusa</t>
 <t id="20082">Seeing the need for better protection of military grade equipment transports, the United Space Command submitted a requisition to ship design teams for a heavily armoured transporter with capacity for high-volume freight. Following trials of multiple submissions, the Mars-designed Hayabusa was the model deemed most suited to the USC's needs.(||) Multiple layers of armour plating on top of a triple-hull, paired with military-grade power systems and finely tuned engines enable this ship to ferry highly sensitive equipment through anything the universe can throw at it. The designers boast that it could easily run through an AGI blockade while fully laden with minimal damage.</t>
 <t id="20091">Mani</t>
 <t id="20092">With the number of Terran billionaires and space-based entrepreneurs growing, the market for a strictly Terran-designed luxury cruiser was recognised. The Mani is the result.(||) Made to fill the gap in the civil markets, it is reasonably heavily armed and adequately shielded, though the actual luxury aspect has taken a secondary role. Built to impress rather than please, the Mani is the posing vessel of the year as impractical as it is fashionable.</t>
 <t id="20101">Kyoto</t>
 <t id="20102">Recognising the need for a more powerful capital ship that would not be controlled strictly by the AGI Task Force, the United Space Command opted to develop their own super-heavy destroyer to perform tasks which the ATF would not. The Kyoto is currently one of the most powerful ships in service with the Terran military.(||) It bears a close resemblance to the Osaka, but closer inspection reveals numerous upgrades and reconfigurations of the internal structure, which result improved combat performance at no additional expense. A surprisingly large amount of the ship's internal systems are operated autonomously without direct human supervision; a feature that sets this vessel apart from its ATF cousin.</t>
 <t id="20111">Toukon</t>
 <t id="20112">The United Space Command commissioned the Toukon after seeing the value of the TM class ships used by the Commonwealth races.(||) Intended to serve as a rapid response patrol carrier, the Toukon improves on established designs without adding any experimental or unstable features. Essentially a Terran variant of the widely successful Magnetar, the Toukon combines the best of both worlds with virtually no downsides.</t>
 <t id="20121">I</t>
 <t id="20122">This powerful destroyer has not been seen anywhere before. It closely follows the standard Xenon design principles, and appears to be a direct response to recent developments in the super-heavy destroyer field.(||) The exact power and threat levels of this ship are not known, but it is advised to run as far away as possible at the first sight of this ship. Like all other Xenon ships, it still contains a redundant crew deck, theoretically enabling living creatures to pilot it.</t>
 <t id="20131">Snotra</t>
 <t id="20132">The Snotra was designed to cover the one area the aging Demeter could not fulfil - rapid transportation of high value military grade hardware.(||) Following the latest Paranid design trends inspired by prototype ships such as the Agamemnon and Heavy Nemesis, the Snotra has lost its former basic utilitarian structure in favour of a more elaborate, artistic profile. The core of the ship has not changed greatly, though - the basic cargo compression systems are taken directly out of other transporters and interior decorations have been left at a minimum. Though the Snotra was designed as a military ship, it is available to any trader rich and influential enough to afford one.</t>
 <t id="20141">Ariadne</t>
 <t id="20142">Following the trend of employing drone carriers in border patrol duty, a strategy established by the Argon with their successful Griffon prototype, the Paranid Empire issued an order for a drone frigate design of their own. Superior to the early Griffon variants in every way, the current Ariadne, the result of several months of corporate espionage and outright plagiarism, is indeed a vastly improved version of the Argon prototype.(||) Unfortunately, the Ariadne is still considered very much a work in progress, and retains a number of issues that would not appear in a more polished, finalised version. Due to pressure from the Priest Kings, the prototype Ariadne blueprints were sent to all major Paranid shipyards before the actual ship could be put through field tests. Nevertheless, the military has not reported any major issues with the ship as yet, so for all intents and purposes, it is a bona fide drone frigate, well worth its price.</t>
 <t id="20151">{17,2911}(Drone)</t>
 <t id="20152">Developed by OTAS corporation in collaboration with every major race in the galaxy, these advanced drones use Heuristic Autonomous Logarithms to acquire targets and can successfully predict a pilot's manoeuvres, evasive actions and skill with 91% accuracy after 12-20 seconds of motion analysis.(||) Although OTAS are promoting these advanced drones as the 'end of manned fighters', many merchants and fleet commanders are unnerved by their efficiency, some going as far as to even label them 'Xenon efficient'. OTAS deny rumours that the drone A.I. consists of reverse-engineered Xenon subroutines and assure their customers that they are safe and reliable.</t>

 <t id="20211">Maccana</t>
 <t id="20212">After public objections to the number of pilots' lives lost in skirmishes against pirates and AGI, the Terran Federation commissioned a new drone frigate design for military use. The Maccana is a semi-automated vessel, allowing for a much smaller crew contingent than other Terran vessels of its size.(||) Its greatest advantage however is the completely automated drone maintenance line, which requires only four overseers. The development of the Maccana is still ongoing, but successful test versions have already been released to the general market, as field tests have proved them to be essentially safe and stable.</t>
 <t id="20221">Griffon</t>
 <t id="20222">The Griffon was the design which kicked off development of similar drone frigates by the other races. Developed with technology bought from the black market, initially originating from Aldrin, its design is surprisingly simple.(||) An exposed framework supporting the drones, a single maintenance line and modified sensor arrays are all that sets this frigate apart from any other capital ship. Even though there are now more technologically advanced drone frigates on the market, the Griffon has had the time to be refined into what is arguably the most reliable frigate in the known universe. With 11 layers of failsafes and multiple redundancies, the ship simply never gives up.</t>
 <t id="20231">Guppy</t>
 <t id="20232">The latest result of the new Boron military diversification campaign, the Guppy is doubtlessly one of the most refined examples of speciality shipbuilding in Boron history.(||) Sleek, spacious and menacing, the Guppy is an excellent border patrol leader. Though it is not the leading vessel in any one characteristic when compared to other drone frigates, the Guppy provides the most rounded and balanced performance. Although it is estimated to be almost twice as expensive to produce as regular frigates, the Guppy is still relatively affordable thanks to heavy government subsidisation. This ship has acquired a status in the industry, serving as the yardstick for its class.</t>
 <t id="20241">Panther</t>
 <t id="20242">Initially designed as a mini-carrier, the Panther proved ineffective in real combat situations and unsuitable for supporting the required pilots and support crews for extended periods of time. With the advance of drone manufacturing technology, the Panther was quickly remodelled to serve as a drone frigate.(||) The improved concept proved itself worthy after a single month of automated patrols. Thanks to a newly designed sensor array, the Panther can manage a large quantity of drones over great distances. The numerous failsafes installed by outsourced Teladi engineers ensure that the Panther's drones can operate without supervision for extended periods of time.</t>
 <t id="20251">Cormorant</t>
 <t id="20252">The Cormorant is the Teladi Company's response to the recent drone frigate trend that has taken the Commonwealth militaries by storm.(||) Cheap, rough, sturdy and completely devoid of any aesthetic embellishment, the Cormorant fulfils its major function of drone management without any unnecessary fuss. Though construction quality is estimated to be extremely low, there are as yet no known cases of these ships spontaneously exploding in flight. The Teladi military has purchased a number of Cormorants, but the main purpose of this ship is to fill a market niche, which is the one task it completely fulfils.</t>

 <t id="20291">Orbital Laser</t>
 <t id="20292">Following skirmishes with Commonwealth forces, the USC were impressed with the potential of Lasertowers for protecting remote sectors without committing an expensive Destroyer.(||) The Terran Orbital Laser is a reverse-engineered and upgraded Terran copy created from samples purchased by some of the few Commonwealth traders allowed into Terran territory. During the design phase, emphasis was moved from fighter defence to a robust anti-capital ship weapon. Even with the recent upgrades to the Commonwealth Lasertower, the Orbital Laser provides a superior defensive emplacement.</t>
 <t id="20351">Argon Stock Exchange</t>
 <t id="20352">Following changes to galactic laws which legalised open trading of stocks and shares, the Teladi Company quickly established a number of these Stock Exchanges. Anyone with a few credits can now purchase shares in a large variety of commodities, companies and corporations. Even in the short time that these stations have been trading, many fortunes have been gained and lost. Each transaction incurs a small brokerage fee, which the Teladi Company claims for services rendered.</t>

 <t id="20431">Plutarch Trading Port</t>
 <t id="20432">The rapid expansion of the Plutarch Mining Corporation led to a sudden surplus of raw minerals. To relieve mines of excess stock and avoid flooding the market, several storage stations were constructed. As production levels stabilised and the surplus was reduced, most of these depots were dismantled, but some were converted into fully functional trading ports.</t>
 <t id="20441">Plutarch Defence Outpost</t>
 <t id="20442">With the onset of war and the corporation's newly built headquarters being located dangerously close to the frontlines, Plutarch invested heavily in defensive assets.(||) To support the growing fleet of escort and patrol ships, defence outposts were constructed in key sectors of interest to PMC. While their primary purpose is to coordinate and resupply their own ships, open trading is sanctioned and Plutarch are now making a tidy profit through weapon sales.</t>
 <t id="20451">Plutarch Development Station</t>
 <t id="20452">Plutarch heavily invested in research once their primary mines started to become depleted. While initially focusing on mining equipment efficiency and recycling, Plutarch soon began to branch into other areas such as drone technology and engines.(||) Plutarch have expressed interest in establishing a research agreement with Jonferco for their upcoming highway technology, though they have yet to strike a deal.</t>
 <t id="20461">Jonferco Trading Station</t>
 <t id="20462">Massive interest in their newly announced highway technology caused a surge of investment into Jonferco. This allowed them to expand their research and commercial divisions.(||) Their trading stations were designed not only to sell their goods but to provide advanced education. These stations feature libraries and presentation halls, often used for teaching of the latest theories and nurturing potential new recruits.</t>
 <t id="20471">Jonferco Equipment Dock</t>
 <t id="20472">Jonferco's research into highways soon took over the real estate of their engine research departments at JSDD headquarters. This forced them to shift all ship and engine development to these new, state of the art stations which also double as equipment docks.</t>
 <t id="20481">Beryll Research Station</t>
 <t id="20482">Not much is known about this station. Ties between the Beryll syndicate and Argon Government have been rumoured although there has been no official confirmation. That said, there has also been no official denial.</t>
 <t id="20491">Jonferco Research Station</t>
 <t id="20492">Jonferco attracts some of the greatest minds in the known universe and these research stations, giving researchers access to state-of-the-art labs and testing facilities are one of the main draws.(||) While not offering much for the average passer-by, these stations regularly enter the news with major breakthroughs, or the occasional minor disaster.</t>
 <t id="20501">Jonferco Defence Outpost</t>
 <t id="20502">With Jonferco researching potentially revolutionary technologies, there was a renewed focus on defence for their assets and employees. With these defence stations and the Argon Military standing by to assist, Jonferco continues development in relative safety.</t>

 <t id="1030221">With the Argon potentially entering a long and drawn out war, they quickly claimed this sector for its resources. While not out of reach of Terran forces, military presence is low until additional infrastructure is constructed. Many colonists have called this reckless and count themselves lucky that the Terrans have not used the opportunity to gain a foothold away from the front line.</t>
 <t id="1030320">This newly colonised system excited many Boron as its primary planet matched many of the criteria they associate with paradise. Its warm, vast oceans are almost unmatched anywhere in the Boron Kingdom and even Argon tourists have begun to flock to its pristine beaches. Several deep water surveys have been launched with one being lost under mysterious circumstances, leading to the spread of sea monster tales by some Argon. This has done little to stem the tide of visitors.</t>
 <t id="1030321">With a notable asteroid field, Teladi managers expected a swarm of opportunistic miners and corporations to lay claim to this sector's many riches. Instead, they found expansion unexpectedly slow. Analysts have proposed possible causes such as the rise of mineral-rich Albion, the over-expansion of NMMC or the more profitable business of gun-running in the Argon-Terran war.</t>
 <t id="1030322">As the furthest Paranid sector from Paranid Prime, colonisation of this sector was slow but methodical. With the Argon also colonising a nearby sector, joint military exercises were proposed to the Paranid in an attempt to improve relations and efficiency in working together. Early into the second exercise, a Terran scout party jumped into the sector, shortly followed by a strike force. The joint Argon and Paranid fleet rotated their forces to contain the superior Terran ships until they were forced to jump back to Terran space. The exercises were considered a success and no further major Terran attacks have since been attempted.</t>
 <t id="1030421">With the Xenon advancing, and the loss of the gate connections to the west, Family Zyarth finds itself running out of territory and resources. This sector has been heavily mined by Family Zyarth to support ship production and the remains of its economy. Fortunately the asteroids in this sector are abundant enough to support the Split in their immediate campaign to defend against the Xenon and eventually push them back.</t>
 <t id="1030503">After having been completely wiped out by the Kha'ak, the remains here had been left untouched as a silent memorial to the countless souls who lost their lives. Plans to rebuild were held back by the fear of further reprisals, but now that the Kha'ak have been mostly wiped from the face of the known universe, Argon officials have decided to give a green light to rebuilding. While this sector may come to life and flourish once again, the scar of the tragedy runs deep and will not be forgotten.</t>
 <t id="1030515">(Harmony of Perpetuity){19,1033005}</t>
 <t id="1030613">(Void of Opportunity)This sector has long been known for its pirate activity, but is now openly claimed by a local pirate clan leader. That this is happening on the doorstep of a core Teladi sector has led to speculation that the Teladi CEO may actually be funding the pirate clan. Rumours suggest that the sector was offered to the clan as payment for the clan's loyalty. This clan is well known for its raids on high-value cargo traders. The Teladi, of course, deny all such accusations, claiming that there would be no profit in such a deal.</t>
 <t id="1030618">(Albion Delta)With Albion's latent mineral wealth, it was no surprise to see several mining corporations clamouring for mining rights. Plutarch Mining Corporation became the front-runner in the contest with their vast funds and readily available fleet of ships. Essentially becoming partners with Jonferco in the Albion endeavour, Plutarch was to showcase the Highway project as a vision of the future, improving both social and economic aspects for any system in which they are installed. The Highway research and technology itself has been withheld from Plutarch, much to the dismay of its top officials.</t>
 <t id="1030620">Bordering a dangerous Xenon system, this sector satisfied the glory-seeking Split for many years until the minor skirmishes turned into a fight for survival. As a major Xenon fleet entered the sector, the west gate mysteriously shut-down, cutting off both the supply lines and escape route.</t>
 <t id="1030621">With the Xenon approaching, the Split found themselves falling back into this desolate system. Supplies are only delivered by jumpdrive or freighter captains mad enough to brave the Xenon forces.</t>
 <t id="1030717">(Albion Alpha)Discovered during recent exploration, Albion was identified by JSDD as one of several sectors in the running to be their new Headquarters, where they could conduct research into more advanced and potentially unstable technology away from stringent Argon oversight and without placing innocent lives at risk. Following the deployment of several Jonferco-built Trans-Orbital Accelerators, the sector was rechristened Albion Alpha, and for undisclosed reasons the gate was towed to the region now known as Albion Gamma.(||)The sector now houses a mixture of high-tech factories and mines. A further facility also resides within this sector; however little information is available due to highly restricted access. This has fuelled numerous rumours about this station's purpose, the most widespread being that potentially-illegal AI research is conducted there with the knowledge and consent of the Argon government.</t>
 <t id="1030718">(Albion Beta)This region was chosen by JSDD as the second sector within the Albion system for settlement. This is most likely due to the slightly higher solar intensity which has led to this area providing most of the energy for Jonferco's operation in the system, fuelling their rapid expansion. In addition to power production facilities, this sector also houses a similar mixture of high and low tech facilities to Albion Alpha, which allows the sector to be largely self-reliant.</t>
 <t id="1030719">(Albion Gamma)Located in a vast, dense ring of debris, the Albion system quickly attracted significant interest from several mining corporations and Jonferson Space Dynamics Division. After heavy mining depleted the most easily accessible resources, Jonferco began to change the face of Albion with their Highway project. Highways promise to create a network of fast travel lanes throughout the entire system. Still under construction, until these devices are operational the gaps between developed regions are linked by Trans-Orbital Accelerators.(||)As the gateway to the Albion system, this sector is heavily patrolled by Jonferco, Plutarch and Argon vessels.</t>
 <t id="1030810">(Unknown Sector){19,1030000}</t>
 <t id="1030815">This sector was claimed under the Military Act by the Argon military authorities, to serve as a buffer for the heavily-militarised Sector M148 beyond the South gate. It is imperative for the Argon to hold M148 given previous Terran advances.</t>
 <t id="1030909">Ruined by dreams of avarice, this sector was originally claimed by a Teladi entrepreneur, eager to expand to ever greater frontiers. But within his investments at Grand Exchange lay the seeds of despair that eventually led to this sector being placed under auction, in the hope that salvation would be financial, if nothing more.</t>
 <t id="1031019">(Mercenaries Rift)This sector was ignored for a long time. Now, with the ongoing war and the associated increase in smuggling and looting activities by pirate raiders, it was just a matter of time before it would become home to one of the local pirate clans.</t>
 <t id="1031119">(Lost Order)Not much is known about what goes on in this sector. It is used as a safe haven by those who don't want to be found. Both pirates and the authorities avoid this sector for the most part.</t>
 <t id="1031206">(Unknown Sector){19,1030000}</t>
 <t id="1031218">(Unknown Sector){19,1030000}</t>
 <t id="1031604">(Quiet Tides)This serene sector was populated by the Boron to support the local economy with agricultural goods. While the nearby pirate sector may represent a threat, this sector is considered to be one of the safest; a perfect place for relaxation.</t>
 <t id="1031608">(Emperor's Pride)This sector has recently been populated by hard-line Paranid religious fanatics who chose to leave Unholy Descent after what they considered to be the sector's decline into unholiness. There is a tense and xenophobic atmosphere in the sector and very little communication exists with its neighbour.</t>
 <t id="1031708">(Unseen Domain)This sector has only recently become part of the Paranid Empire. It hosts Paranid citizens who feel that a life of exclusion and exile are the only true way to enlightenment. The Paranid in this sector have little time for lesser beings and even less inclination to have any dealings with them. This is reflected by the distinct lack of trading opportunities in the sector.</t>
 <t id="1031709">(Unknown Sector){19,1030000}</t>
 <t id="1031711">(Lasting Vengeance)This little-known sector has been occupied by the Paranid Pirate Duke and his army, known for their coldness and cruelty. Only a very few ships are allowed to enter the sector, and only a few of those dare to do business with the Duke.</t>
 <t id="1031719">(Distant Clouds)This sector, claimed only very recently, is the result of a Boron Royal Research Institute effort to scout for rare minerals in asteroid-rich sectors. Given its proximity to Boron territory and the absence of any objections from other interested parties, a major mineral survey was set in motion. Unfortunately the effort did not pay off and no particularly valuable minerals were found. It is now home to a small mining colony in the hopes that at least some of the costs can be recouped.</t>
 <t id="1033800">In times of war, destruction, changing gate connections and disappearing sectors, this particular sector marks something different. Found in a new part of space unknown to the various races and so untouched by their altercations, this sector was found while trying to forge connections between other known parts of the galaxy. However, its actual location in the universe remains unknown. Its appearance is as enigmatic as its discovery and location. A glowing blue field crosses the sector and illuminates all of its planets with its ethereal glow. These planets may hide unimaginable treasures. This is the perfect location for making a new beginning in undisturbed peace, or for launching a surprise assault on an enemy from a completely unexpected location. Only time will tell its use and ultimate fate.</t>

 <t id="1560">To change this into a language that the computer can understand</t>
 <t id="1561">you must encrypt it using the cipher key that is given. To</t>
 <t id="1562">encipher a letter simply find the letter in the alphabet</t>
 <t id="1563">that is n number of places after the letter given, where n</t>
 <t id="1564">is the corresponding number for the cipher that is given</t>
 <t id="1565">For example to encipher the word 'hello' with the cipher 12345 you would do this:\n\n'h' is the first letter with a corresponding value of 1. One letter after 'h' is i. The answer is 'i'.\n'e' has a corresponding value of 2. Two letters after 'e' is 'g'.\nThis process is repeated for each letter.</t>
 <t id="1571">For the example above the answer would be 'igopt'</t>
 <t id="1572">If there is a '!' in the cipher given, that means that there</t>
 <t id="1573">needs to be no change to the corresponding letter.</t>

<page id="383942" title="Commander Derik" descr="0" voice="yes">
 <t id="20">How can I be of assistance?</t>
 <t id="26">(laugh)I don't think so!</t>
 <t id="40">No problem, look near the </t>
 <t id="41">It's right here, pilot!</t>
 <t id="43">Sorry, I don't know.</t>
 <t id="45">North gate.</t>
 <t id="46">South gate.</t>
 <t id="47">West gate.</t>
 <t id="48">East gate.</t>
 <t id="10000">Good to meet you, pilot. I'm Commander Derik, you're just in time to meet the other new recruits. As one of the more experienced flyboys of this group, we've seen fit to give you the rank of Sergeant. Please, form up with the others; I will soon begin the briefing for your first flight.</t>
 <t id="10001">This is Commander Derik to all members of the Argon Special Task Force 87. I'm transmitting coordinates to your navigational computers; form up at this location for briefing and assignment.</t>
 <t id="10002">Well it seems you nuggets can at least follow waypoints. I'm Commander Derik, the commanding officer of Argon Special Task Force 87. While I'm sure you all know the challenges we face, I want to reiterate our duty in defending the Argon Federation and her allies.</t>
 <t id="10003">We are at war with an enemy we know all too well, the Terrans; our brothers in blood. Our job is to forget that and just protect our civilians and our territory. Be this on the front line, escorting freighters or deploying Laser Towers at every gate from here to Argon Prime, we will be where we are needed.</t>
 <t id="10004">We will represent the best of what the Community of Planets has to offer. Not all of you are fighter pilots or trade moguls. We are not all even the same species and that diversity is what makes us strong in fighting for this common goal.</t>
 <t id="10005">Now, that's enough for the rousing speeches, we've got work to do. Several sectors on the Argon-Terran border are in a state of conflict. We have a network of agents on installations throughout these sectors who are offering tasks which need immediate attention. Do your best to help bail these souls out of the crazola until we contact you for Task Force duty. Good luck out there pilots, show those Terrans what the best of the Commonwealth can do.</t>
 <t id="10006">Sergeant, you've been doing some good work so far. We've prepared a special task just for you, return to homebase as soon as you can.</t>
 <t id="10007">Sergeant, we have a situation with the Jonferson Space Dynamics Division or Jonferco. We've had reports of advanced Jonferco technology finding its way onto Terran ships and with the corporation's past ties to the Terrans, we are beginning an investigation.</t>
 <t id="10008">A contact within Jonferco HQ informs us that a meeting will shortly take place in the Albion sector between Jonferco and a potential buyer. All signs point to a demonstration of new technology developed in Albion.</t>
 <t id="10009">You will wait in Albion for the meeting to take place and report back on the proceedings. Whatever happens there, do not get involved. The last thing we need to do is to draw more attention to the Albion sector. You will need a few specialised tools for this mission, so we are providing you with a suitable ship. Good luck.</t>
 <t id="10010">Sergeant, we have received word that the meeting is already underway. You must find the Jonferco Command Ship somewhere in your sector. We have engaged listening protocols on your ship's computer so you can intercept their ship-to-ship communications. Again, do not get drawn into any conflict; at the first sign of trouble, disengage and return to base. We will be monitoring communications remotely. Derik out.</t>
 <t id="10011">Jonferco ships have entered the sector. Hold position and wait for the others.</t>
 <t id="10012">Paranid!? What are they doing here? We're going to radio silence, try to get as much information as possible but don't get too close.</t>
 <t id="10013">Sergeant, while that meeting didn't involve the Terrans, it did answer a few questions about their recent activities. While I'm sure eyebrows will be raised about the Paranid being involved, we still have no proof that Jonferco are directly trading technology with the Terrans. We will continue to contact them through official channels for clarification on where they stand.</t>
 <t id="10014">You did well today. Feel free to go about your business, we will contact you again when we have another task for you.</t>
 <t id="10015">If you want to take some R and R away from the front, I hear some of the other pilots have been trying to play the Stock Market. If you play it right, it's easy money without needing a fleet of freighters. If you get it wrong, well, you can always eat in the mess and the cost will be deducted from your next paycheque.</t>
 <t id="10016">Sergeant, please return to Sector M148. There have been developments with Jonferco.</t>
 <t id="10017">Thank you for returning promptly, Sergeant. I believe you've already met Administrator Colbern of Jonferco?</t>
 <t id="10018">Administrator Colbern was just proposing a very interesting arrangement. Something I think is quite suited to your skillset.</t>
 <t id="10019">Jonferco are just as concerned with finding their technology on Terran ships as we are. You will be tasked with aiding Jonferco in protecting their ships and continuing the investigation into how the Terrans have gotten access to this research. You will report to Administrator Colbern for assignments but be aware that you could be pulled back to front line service at any time.</t>
 <t id="10020">I've arranged for control of a new ship to be transferred to you for this mission. Additional support ships will be standing by if needed, but we don't want to draw attention to the convoy unless necessary. Dismissed.</t>
 <t id="10021">This is Derik. We're redirecting nearby forces to Interworlds. Hang in there and stay away from the gates.</t>
 <t id="10022">Support ships are on their way. They will clear the north gate, then head south. Sergeant, join them when you can.</t>
 <t id="10023">They're attempting to blockade the gate. Close in but beware of that capital ship.</t>
 <t id="10024">Sergeant, stay out of range of that capital ship. It'll tear you to shreds!</t>
 <t id="10025">This is Derik to all ships, disengage and regroup in Wastelands.</t>
 <t id="10026">Paranid forces have entered the sector and are engaging the Terrans! All ships, get back in there and give them a hand!</t>
 <t id="10027">Good work out there Sergeant. Colbern and I will oversee the handover of the JSDD research to the Paranid. I'll contact you when we have tasks for you. You're on a roll. See if you can be of use in the conflicted sectors. Derik out.</t>
 <t id="10028">Jonferco Headquarters has been lost. Survivors are on several ships leaving the combat area. Multiple Terran ships and Orbital Lasers remain. Destroy those Orbital Lasers to clear the way for our capital ships.</t>
 <t id="10029">Sergeant, please return to Homebase.</t>
 <t id="10030">As you can expect, Colbern has his hands full. Along with their Headquarters, several Jonferco ships were targeted by the Terrans. We are still not sure why.</t>
 <t id="10031">Jonferco is in a vulnerable position, as is Albion. This sector is very important to the war effort and the future of the Community of Planets. Jonferco was tasked with defending the sector but with their remaining forces so stretched, we doubt they can fulfil that obligation. Argon Command can't commit any further forces away from the war. We must aid Albion and Jonferco in any way possible.</t>
 <t id="10032">There are some tasks Colbern would like to see completed. We will upload the mission information to your ship-board computer.</t>
 <t id="10033">This is Commander Derik to all Task Force ships, we have a situation in Albion; a group of ships are attempting to raid a Jonferco research station. Render assistance immediately.</t>
 <t id="10034">Sergeant, there is another Research Station in Albion which is crucial to the war effort. They have not yet been attacked but it's just a matter of time. We would like you to bolster their defences with Laser Towers. We will send you information on their location.</t>
 <t id="10035">You handled the Beryll well, Sergeant. We never know what to expect with those people, always playing with AI technology and Xenon. If they weren't so crucial to the war effort, they would be in a penal colony.</t>
 <t id="10036">The situation in Albion seems to be calming down. The Plutarch Mining Corporation has surprisingly taken up security duty for the whole sector while Jonferco gets back on its feet. Colbern has requested that we take a look at the Highway construction areas; pirates have been seen scanning and salvaging them. If they are still there, take them out.</t>
 <t id="10037">Things are looking up in Albion. The security situation has improved and people are starting to flood into the sector. It seems that Jonferco's promise of highways bringing prosperity is not falling on deaf ears.</t>
 <t id="10038">On the other hand, while we've been babysitting Jonferco, the front lines have taken a beating. Head over there and see what you can do to aid some of the sectors in conflict.</t>
 <t id="10039">Return to homebase. We have a breakthrough in the Jonferco investigation.</t>
 <t id="10040">We have had a tip off from someone claiming to know how the Terrans got hold of Jonferco technology and why the Terrans are attacking JSDD assets. The contact said that he or she will meet us at a neutral location.</t>
 <t id="10041">You know it is. You have already told us you work for PMC so I assume it is someone within your corporation. I also assume that you want to benefit from giving us information, so what are your demands?</t>
 <t id="10042">What could he possibly have told the Terrans to make them systematically attack Jonferco the way they did?</t>
 <t id="10043">It sounds tarnished enough already. What mistake is he about to make?</t>
 <t id="10044">Director Falos, I seriously hope you're wrong about this.</t>
 <t id="10045">There's too many ships for us to engage and reinforcements won't get here fast enough.</t>
 <t id="10046">Let's see how loyal your PMC crews are. This is Commander Derik of the Argon Special Task Force. I am countermanding your orders to not engage, defend the Jonferco station!</t>
 <t id="10047">Sound the evacuation orders. We'll do what we can.</t>
 <t id="10048">Come on people, take them out! Protect the evacuating ships!</t>
 <t id="10049">Scanner is clear, that's the lot of them.</t>
 <t id="10050">All PMC ships, stand down. With immediate effect, you are to follow all orders from Lieutenant Falk Borman of the Argon Special Task Force while this incident is being investigated.</t>
 <t id="10051">Director Falos, I suggest you prepare your evidence and inform your board of directors of the upcoming inquiry. If PMC is to survive, you will all have to defend it. Your corporation has a lot to answer for.</t>
 <t id="10052">Sergeant, this mess will take an age to clear up and we've been distracted long enough. Go to the Beryll Research Station, You'll find something of use there. Take it and do what you can for the war effort. Thank you for your service in this matter. Your performance and dedication have been outstanding. Derik out.</t>
 <t id="10053">Pilot, this really was a missed opportunity. While this meeting didn't involve Terrans, it did involve the Paranid. Knowing how far their dealings went would have given us leverage over Jonferco in this investigation. Go about your business, we will contact you again when we have a task for you.</t>
 <t id="10054">Thank you Lord Captain. Please stand by while the transport resumes its course.</t>
 <t id="10055">All ships, Terran vessels are attacking Jonferco Headquarters. Render immediate assistance.</t>

 <t id="46">South gate.</t>
 <t id="47">West gate.</t>
 <t id="48">East gate.</t>
 <t id="10000">Up ahead we have the highway construction area. It takes us several weeks to build and configure each gate but we have several production lines and are investing in more avenues of research to speed up the process.</t>
 <t id="10001">No. Our first tests were scheduled for two weeks' time but the escalation of the war has forced us to rethink our timetable.</t>
 <t id="10002">We also anticipated this outcome, so I have authority to provide you with all of our highway research and three prototype highway gates. I'm sure your scientists will be able to verify our findings. These highways will be powerful tools, opening up entire solar systems in a way we had never before dreamed possible. As with all powerful technologies though, it can be abused. We trust that you will use it wisely.</t>
 <t id="10003">It pleases me to hear that.</t>
 <t id="10004">Unfortunately, we must pause proceedings. We have detected a suspicious ship nearby, it could be attempting to listen in on our conversation.</t>
 <t id="10005">Yes, it was a brief encounter, but one that almost ruined months of work. Still, I understand why the military wants to keep tabs on us during a war, especially with these accusations.</t>
 <t id="10006">We are aware of a possible leak within Jonferco and in addition to that, the Terrans are actively attacking our assets. Our focus is still to continue developing the Highway technology and building a test bed in Albion, but with these constant attacks and a potential leak, it is becoming quite difficult. </t>
 <t id="10007">The first job is one you are already familiar with. We are delivering several prototype highway gates to the Paranid. The ship carrying the gates is already en-route. Please join the escort group while it travels to the drop-off point.</t>
 <t id="10008">CEO Landon?</t>

 <t id="10010">Derik, we have to go, now! That station is only protected by PMC ships.</t>

 <t id="10003">This offer would be acceptable to us. I am accustomed to Argon being short-sighted and unworthy of our attention, it is agreeable to see some Argon attempting to emulate Paranid levels of foresight and preparation.</t>
 <t id="10004">Indeed. That ship reeks of Argon Secret Service. It appears that your security leaves much to be desired. Let us hope that your designers are of a better calibre.</t>

 <t id="10001">Thank you again, Sergeant. I have spoken with Commander Derik regarding further work you can do for us.</t>
 <t id="10002">This Research Station is where we develop new drone technologies based on the Terraformer and Xenon ships. It was this technology which turned the war to our favour in the Solar System and led to the Torus over Earth being destroyed.</t>
 <t id="10003">However, we are still running low on materials. We need several Xenon ships to continue our line of research. If you could acquire and deliver these ships to us we will reward you in some of the technology we have been developing.</t>
 <t id="10004">Great work. This will keep us busy for a while. If you take a look at the ships docked at this station, you will see that some have been gifted to you. You've earned them.</t>

 <t id="10000">Greetings. I am Falos Disanos Hunas I, Director of Economic Development at Plutarch Mining Corporation. I have uncovered information which I know you would be most interested in; why the Terrans have so viciously targeted Jonferco and how the Terrans gained Jonferco research information. This is valuable information to you, yes?</t>
 <t id="10001">Simply that you understand that I, nor any other at PMC could stop it. All of these deeds are down to the CEO of the Plutarch Mining Corporation himself.</t>
 <t id="10002">Yes. By using spies throughout Jonferco, he sold much information to the Terrans. So much profit, but, he sought a larger prize, something he could not control while Jonferco remained so strong.</t>
 <t id="10003">That they constructed the Terraformer fleet which ravaged their territory. Once Jonferco could no longer protect Albion, mercenaries were hired to raid your remaining research facilities and cause chaos in Albion. I have proof for you to review but time is short. Landon is about to make a fatal mistake which will tarnish this corporation forever.</t>
 <t id="10004">He will take a mercenary fleet to Albion and destroy the Jonferco research station, their last major hold in the sector.</t>
 <t id="10005">I am not. But remember that the people of PMC itself will not take part in this attack. Our crews will not hesitate to assist us if we order them.</t>
 <t id="10006">Landon! He's in there somewhere! The PMC ships are following his orders not to engage. They cannot ignore this threat further. Order them to attack.</t>
 <t id="10007">As will we. This madness has to stop and we have just the ship for the job!</t>
 <t id="10008">Understood Commander. However, I believe the one responsible has just met a fitting end. I await our next meeting.</t>

 <t id="100001">Sergeant,\n\nI just read the bulletin from Atreus. The latest word is that they have already decided on their response to the abduction of the Boron citizens and Mahi Ma. They will soon declare war, throwing the Boron headlong into the conflict against the Terrans. This was widely expected at some stage but the unknown factor is the Gate Hub and how it will affect the war. The Argon Government will likely suggest a joint operation involving the Gate Hub in the war, for use in mass evacuations or rapid response.\n\nContinue working with Atreus. If the joint operation goes ahead, you may well be in the middle of it.\n\n[center][select value='next']Close[/select][/center]</t>
 <t id="105001">Greetings again {player.name}. Thank you again for your prior assistance. Those missiles will help us immensly.\n\nA short time ago, we were contacted by Commander Derik of the Argon Special Task Force. Derik is a highly respected Argon among our people and he has several Boron in his ranks. With his endorsement and your standing record, we see fit to disclose to you further information regarding our current projects and possible future tasks.\n\nThe timing could not be better! We will soon be welcoming back a scientific expedition to the mysterious Hub. Our scientists have been conducting research studies on this ancient facility for the last six months and are due to reconnect to the gate network. We, along with the Boron Military, will provide security for the sectors connected to the Hub. Not everyone is happy that a facility of such power is in Boron hands, especially the Split and Terrans.\n\nWe will provide you with current security arrangements and inform you where you can assist us.\n\n[center][select value='next']Download Information[/select][/center]</t>
 <t id="105002">All ships stand ready. The Hub is due to connect between {sector.name@L2M020.QueensHarbour} and {sector.name@L2M020.QueensRetribution}.</t>
 <t id="105003">Behold the Gate Hub, {player.name}! Such an impressive structure, yes? Our research team has already re-established contact with us and have requested assistance in preparing for the next phase of research. We will be transfering their research, clearing waste and restocking their supplies.\n\n[center][select value='next']OK[/select][/center]</t>
 <t id="105004">Nice work there.</t>
 <t id="105005">While it's unfortunate that you were unable to complete the task, we have others on their way to deliver similar equipment.</t>
 <t id="105006">The researchers really need all the space they can get for supplies. The previous head researcher, {3895,30}(Mahi Ma), filled most of the storage areas with thousands of Microchips. We're still getting rid of the surplus. Speaking of Mahi Ma, he is set to return to head the next stage of research.</t>
 <t id="105007">I will contact you when the researchers are ready to receive the next batch of supplies.</t>
 <t id="105008">We have come up with a list of food supplies for the researchers. Please take a look and aid us in meeting our quota. You don't have to take on the whole task yourself. We've temporarily opened trading on the {object.name@L2M020.HUB} so other traders can also help. Your mission information will keep you up to date with the progress.\n\n[center][select value='next']Download Information[/select][/center]</t>
 <t id="105009">Wonderful news. We have reached our quota for the food supplies on the Gate Hub. We will contact you soon with information on the next stage before research begins again.</t>
 <t id="105010">I assume you've heard. Things are begining to move very quickly. There is talk of a possible rescue attempt for the abducted Boron by Argon and Boron forces. Our task is to continue preparing the Hub for use, potentially even military use. Such a shame to bring war to this magnificent construction.\n\nThe next stage is restocking the {lookup.type.name@SS_WARE_ENERGY} for the gate realignment. Please aid us in reaching our goal of {value@L2M020.SS_WARE_ENERGY_Amount} {lookup.type.name@SS_WARE_ENERGY}.\n\n[center][select value='next']OK[/select][/center]</t>
 <t id="105011">We have met our target for {lookup.type.name@SS_WARE_ENERGY}, making the Hub ready for use again.\n\nThere has been an interesting development, however, which changes our immediate plans. The Argon are to join us in the Hub endeavour, not only for military purposes but for research too. They seem to believe that the Hub may hold the key to turning the tide of the war, not only though surprise attacks but also by aiding the other races in the name of the Argon and Boron people. That's where things become interesting for you. You will be granted access to one of the three sets of gates controlled by the Hub and be able to use the Hub as a personal base. You will represent the Argon Military on the Hub, with Atreus co-ordinating when the need arises.\n\nOur first task however does not directly involve the war, but is to aid the Split. Given the Boron history with the Split, that feels strange to say.\n\n[center][select value='next']Close[/select][/center]</t>
 <t id="105012">Very good! The gate connection appears to be stable and the Split have begun preparing ships for transit. It will take some time before the Hub is ready to reconfigure. We have been told to prepare the Hub for its next use, so please ensure that when the time comes we have enough {lookup.type.name@SS_WARE_ENERGY} to make a connection.\n\n[center][select value='next']Close[/select][/center]</t>
 <t id="105013">Half of the time has passed until the Hub can be used again. Continue maintaining the number of {lookup.type.name@SS_WARE_ENERGY} as we will use it as soon as possible. A mission to rescue Mahi Ma and the other Boron citizens is underway in the Solar System and we will provide an additional escape route if needed.\n\n[center][select value='next']Close[/select][/center]</t>
 <t id="105014">The Hub is ready to connect again and I have received orders to connect the Hub to a border Terran sector to aid the ship evacuating the Boron citizens. The sector, {sector.name@L2M020.Segaris}, is rumoured to be an old Terran colony from many centuries ago, recently reclaimed. It's on the edge of their space so there should be minimal traffic passing the gates. We will have many ships ready to intercept any Terran ships who enter the Hub. Please make the connection to {sector.name@L2M020.Segaris}; we've added its location to your Nav Computer and made all Hub gates available to you.\n\n[center][select value='next']Close[/select][/center]</t>
 <t id="105015">Mahi Ma and the other Boron citizens are safely on board the Hub where their ship will be fitted with a Jumpdrive and can then continue onwards to a medical facility. The Hub is still in a precarious situation with the connection to the Terran sectors so those gates should be realigned as soon as possible. There are currently no other standing orders so please use the Hub as you see fit until orders are passed down.\n\n[center][select value='next']OK[/select][/center]</t>
 <t id="107001">The station has successfully been registered to us; many thanks. It is important for NMMC to continue expanding in these troubling times. Competition with rivals such as Plutarch can make weak corporations crumble, but it forces us to take extreme measures which ultimately makes us richer.\n\nOne of our extreme measures is nearing completion. Fly to and dock at the Plutarch HQ. We will have your computer interface with their networks and retrieve a data mining worm(computer virus) which has been collecting data for several months. We hope to shed some light on their own extreme measures.\n\n[center][select value='next']OK[/select][/center]</t>
 <t id="107002">The information collected by the worm is too sensitive to be transmitted. Please return to us to upload the data. We ask that you are prompt, as Plutarch may soon realise what has transpired and send ships to intercept you.\n\n[center][select value='next']OK[/select][/center]</t>
 <t id="107003">Very good. There is a vast amount of data: communication logs, ship movements, inventory summaries. Our goal is to find evidence that Plutarch is behind the string of attacks on our freighters. This data will not only be of use to us but perhaps the Argon with their investigation into Plutarch's activities. While we explore the possibility to profit from this data, we must continue with our normal activities.\n\nThe rise of Plutarch in Albion and the attacks on our freighters have left us in a position of stagnation. Some believe that we lack the innovation and desire to succeed. We shall prove them wrong with pilots like you.\n\nWe must restock our supply of the rare mineral {lookup.type.name@SS_WARE_NIVIDIUM2}. To aid you in this task, we are giving you a {lookup.type.name@SS_WARE_UNFOCUS_JUMP} which will allow you to jump to distant space and back again. While we have lost pilots there in the past, those who have returned tell of new and exciting areas of space. Perhaps you will find profit.\n\n[center][select value='next']Close[/select][/center]</t>
 <t id="107004">We did not expect you to return so soon and with all of the {lookup.type.name@SS_WARE_NIVIDIUM2}. We have made progress in our study of the data collected from Plutarch and it seems we were correct to suspect them. There were multiple fund transfers to an unknown group, which we expect is a pirate syndicate, as well as information on our ship movements. It seems that Plutarch has been hiring mercenaries to attack our ships and stations.\n\nWe believe an attack is likely very soon so we have diverted extra defence assets to the apparent target in {sector.name@L2M021.Scale_Plate_Green}. Please join them and respond to any disturbances.\n\n[center][select value='next']OK[/select][/center]</t>
 <t id="107005">It pleases me to call you a fellow mogul. Much profit was saved today and we have a chance to deliver a great loss to the enemy. {3895,107007}</t>
 <t id="107006">It appears that we were not destined to profit in this battle. However, do not rest. {3895,107007}</t>
 <t id="107007">We have the location of the {object.name@L2M021.PirateBase}. In the name of profit, reduce it to debris!\n\n[center][select value='next']OK[/select][/center]</t>
 <t id="107008">Let us hope that this action will lead to our ships again being safe. We at NMMC have much to restore as a result of these attacks.\n\nI have an offer for you, which will be profitable for both you and NMMC as a whole. We are to begin a process of selling assets to restructure our corporation. You deserve to see the greatest prize first and for a discounted price. Please return to me to discuss the details.\n\n[center][select value='next']OK[/select][/center]</t>
 <t id="107009">It was a pleasure doing business with you. This revenue will go a long way to restoring NMMC to its rightfully dominant place. I do hope that the {lookup.type.name@SS_DOCK_P_HQ} brings you profit; just none of ours.\n\n[center][select value='next']Close[/select][/center]</t>

It is capable of intercepting existing gate connections, so by using its three sets of gates it can create 'shortcuts' through the known gate network. The Gate Hub was discovered by {3895,32}(Julian Brennan) and {3895,55}(Bala Gi), connected to a Xenon sector. While exploring through one of the connected gates they inadvertently became stranded. The ensuing search by the Boron lead to the existence of the Hub being made known to all. The Boron lead the program of restoration and research, becoming the stewards of the Gate Hub, much to the dismay of the Split and, later, the Terrans.</t>

 <t id="10">[center][b]Terran Research Data - Xperimental Shuttle[/b][/center]\n\n[left][u]Historical Data:[/u][/left]\n\n\33W2905 A.D.\33X\nA Terraformer vessel enters the Solar system. With no indication of any additional Terraformers nearby, Terran pilots Ayse McCallum and John Friedmann aboard salvage ship Rii-4 begin recovery operations. Unfortunately, the Terraformer is still active and manages to destroy the Rii-4 and its two pilots, but not before receiving critical damage. Four days later the USC Eldridge manages to recover the remains of both Rii-4 and the Terraformer ship.\n\nAnalysis of the Terraformer ship uncovers a previously unknown piece of technology: a jumpdrive capable of performing jumps without the need to exit through a jumpgate. In an attempt to discover where the Terraformer ship came from and to evaluate the potential danger, the Terran government decides to reverse-engineer and recreate its own prototype of the point-to-point jumpdrive.\n\n\33W2912 A.D.\33X\nAn Xperimental test shuttle, known colloquially as simply Xperimental, is built and equipped with the prototype point-to-point jumpdrive. Chosen for the first test flight is Captain Kyle William Brennan. The first jump fails and contact with both Brennan and his ship is lost. In an attempt to recover Captain Brennan, Major Elena Kho is sent to trace his steps, but is lost as well.\nAfter losing two experienced pilots, the Terran government ceases research into the point-to-point jumpdrive project. Instead, the creation of a large defensive fleet is authorised in order to prepare for the inevitable return of the Terraformers.\n\n\33W2936 A.D.\33X\nThe Earth gate reactivates unexpectedly. Following more than 20 years of buildup, the Terran fleets are prepared to repulse an attack, but despite expectations, it is the races of the Community of Planets \(today also known as Commonwealth\) who make contact with Earth and not the Terraformers. Captain Kyle William Brennan and Major Elena Kho return to Earth.\n\n________________________\n\nFrom the information we have gathered from Captain Brennan and Major Kho we know that the Xperimental was dismantled by the Goners in order to reverse engineer the jumpdrive. Although Captain Brennan and Major Kho also attempted to recreate the Jumpdrive during their time in the Community of Planets, even founding their own Corporation by the name of 'Terracorp' for this purpose, neither they or the Commonwealth races managed to build anything capable of reproducing the results.\n\nBut now a replica of the Xperimental has been sighted; while as yet it has only been possible to confirm that this replica visually resembles the old Xperimental, we cannot discount the possibility that it also holds information on the original's experimental point-to-point jumpdrive. And so, the Department of Reacquisition was tasked with locating and securing that vessel.</t>
 <t id="11">[center][b]Terran Research Data - Unfocussed Jumpdrive[/b][/center]\n\nNot much is known about this device. We first learned of it when our agents began receiving more and more reports from pilots claiming to have seen ships jumping into sectors far away from any jumpgate. Further investigations revealed that all reports referred to the same group, all of whom were known to be connected to the Goners.\n\nBased on the involvement of the Goners following Kyle Brennan's arrival in the Commonwealth and their role in deconstructing the Xperimental Shuttle, it is possible that they are still trying to recreate the point-to-point jumpdrive. Unfortunately we have not been able to obtain any solid information at this time.</t>
 <t id="12">[center][b]Terran Research Data - Multifunctional ship equipment function[/b][/center]\n\nTerran military researchers have been working for a long time on a way to accelerate the production and equipping of ships. The result of their research is the multifunctional ship equipment function. Integrated into a new multipurpose ship production facility, it is designed to automatically apply predefined equipment sets to the constructed ships. Robots will ensure that all weapons and shields are correctly installed and tested prior to the ship's departure from the station. At the outbreak of the war with the Argon, development was in its final stages and we had planned to build one of those new ship production and equipment facilities in the very near future.\n\nDue to its security classification, the plans of the multifunctional ship equipment function were stored in the databases of the Torus and we believed them lost following its destruction, but based on reports from our agents we now know that somehow the Boron have acquired them. According to our information, the Boron managed to finish the development and integrate them into their own so-called "Headquarters" station.</t>
 <t id="13">[center][b]The Boron Kingdom enters the Terran war[/b][/center]\n\nDespite recent negotiations between USC high command and Boron diplomats in the hope of finding a peaceful solution, the Boron Kingdom has declared war on the Terrans and announced joint operations with the Argon in the border sectors. The Boron Kingdom is following the same spurious arguments the Argons used to justify their aggression against Terran society. While regretting this decision, the Terran government has already made clear that any hostile actions by the Boron Kingdom will be answered with military force. A general warning to all Terran pilots has been issued with advice to retreat from Boron space as quickly as possible.\n\n[center][select value='next']Close[/select][/center]</t>

 <t id="101">{player.name}, this is Admiral Chianna Giorno of USC high command. We have been monitoring your war efforts for some time now and are very impressed with the tremendous ability you have shown in defending the Terran border sectors. We are planning a highly classified mission which we believe your talents would be perfect for. If you are interested, report to the Orbital Defence Station in {7,1020314}.\n\nAdmiral Giorno out.</t>
 <t id="102">Thank you for coming, {player.name}. Please note that the following briefing is top secret.\n\n[center][select value='next']I understand[/select][/center]</t>
 <t id="103">In the initial years following the reunion of Terran and Commonwealth governments, many diplomatic ships visited our territory. Although the USC high command was always careful about releasing information and technologies to the Commonwealth races, it did not take long for them to show their true colours. Promises were broken, research agreements abandoned and classified technologies stolen. We are certain that some of these stolen technologies were used to invade the Terran sectors in the recent conflict, to destroy the Torus and to kill thousands of innocent Terran people.\n\nWe cannot allow the Commonwealth to retain these technologies; to that end, USC high command has decided to reacquire them. We need you to fulfil this task.\n\n[center][select value='Ok']Ok, I'm ready.[/select][/center]</t>

 <t id="105">We have provided you with a list of our stolen technologies, which are scattered throughout the universe. Your job is it to find out what the Commonwealth races know about these technologies and, where possible, reacquire them. Your ship's computer will provide you with additional information.\n\nIf USC involvement in this is discovered by the Commonwealth governments, it could draw more races into the conflict, so we will be unable to render any direct assistance or backup for this task; in short, you will be on your own. The only assistance we can provide is access to our network of agents within the Commonwealth. While several of our agents were killed or captured during the war, those that maintained their cover still possess valuable information, which will surely help your mission.\n\nGood luck pilot, USC high command and the whole Terran society count on you.\n\nAdmiral Giorno out.\n\n[center][select value='end']I'm on my way.[/select][/center]</t>
 <t id="110">{player.name}, this is Admiral Giorno. We have an urgent situation developing that we need you to deal with. Your current mission will need to wait until the situation is resolved.</t>
 <t id="111">Meet Ensign Val Jorwan at {object.name@L2M022.EnsignStation} in {7,1021009}. He will provide you with all the necessary information.</t>
 <t id="112">{player.name}, this is Admiral Giorno. What has come over you? Your inconsiderate actions put the whole operation at risk. Fortunately, Lt. Heywood and Ensign Jorwan were able to hijack Mahi Ma's ship without your help and escort him to Terran territory. I hope that this mishap was a one-off and that you will remember the importance of your future assignments and will treat them with more seriousness. Giorno out.</t>
 <t id="113">One of the technologies the Commonwealth races have stolen from us are the Jump Beacons. What we initially developed as a means of accelerating travel through our territory is now being used against us. The Commonwealth races placed several of these beacons in their territories to improve their supply chains. Destroying them would severely hamper their war efforts.</t>
 <t id="114">{player.name}, this is Admiral Giorno. During an interrogation session, Mahi Ma revealed very interesting information about the Xenon HUB. There may be chance to take over the HUB. Report to {object.name@L2M022.SegarisDock} in {7,1021117}, so we can discuss the details of the plan.</t>
 <t id="115">Based on the information Mahi Ma finally revealed, we have come up with a plan that will hopefully enable us to take over the HUB. The plan is as dangerous as it is simple, so we need someone with great military experience to fulfil this task, someone like you.\n\nAccording to our information the Boron have already activated the HUB. Nevertheless, they still need Mahi Ma to reconfigure it. We are sure that the Boron military will take any chance to rescue him, even if they jeopardise their own safety to do so. This is the weakness we are going to take advantage of.</t>
 <t id="116">Using our remaining agents in the Community of Planets, we are leaking misinformation that Mahi Ma and his attendants plan to escape from Segaris. We are expecting the Boron to connect the HUB with Segaris once Mahi Ma's TP reaches the West Gate. We have already positioned our forces close enough to the gate to allow us to quickly enter the HUB, while still avoiding suspicion.\n\nYour job is it to lead the task force by flying Mahi Ma's ship to the HUB. We have made adjustments to the life support systems so that they will think that Mahi Ma is aboard your ship. The ruse will only fool them for a short while, but hopefully it will be long enough for the fleet to enter the HUB.</t>
 <t id="117">Once we have entered the HUB, there is only one task: Destroy all present Argon and Boron ships and take over the HUB. We're expecting a short but intense fight. If you need to prepare, now would be the time. When you are ready, return here and our attack run can start.\n\n[center][select value='Ok']Ok[/select][/center]</t>
 <t id="118">Well done, {player.name}. The HUB is ours. You have led our forces in a great victory and dealt the Boron a blow they surely hadn't expected.\n\nDue to your great success in the war and your proven loyalty, USC high command unanimously decided to transfer control of the HUB to you. Someone with your military knowledge will surely be able to use the HUB to the advantage of Terran society. Giorno out.</t>
 <t id="120">Pilot, your security level has dropped to an unacceptable level. To ensure the security of our agents and operations, we must insist that all of our agents meet minimum security levels. Until you reach this level again, all official activities will be placed on hold.</t>
 <t id="121">Pilot, your security level is back to an acceptable level. You are authorised to resume contact with our network of agents and to continue with your assignments.</t>
 <t id="122">{player.name}, this is Admiral Giorno. What has come over you? By losing the Xperimental replica, you have put the whole operation at risk. I hope that this mishap was a one-off and that you will remember the importance of your future assignments and will treat them with more seriousness. Giorno out.</t>
 <t id="123">Everything is ready and our forces are in place. Enter the {object.name@L2M022.FakeMahiMaTP} and fly to {sector@L2M022.HUB}.\n\nGood luck Pilot, Admiral Giorno out.</t>
 <t id="200">Lt. Patricia Heywood</t>
 <t id="201">{102,20}(Yes, what do you want?)</t>
 <t id="202">Excuse me! You did say your clock was correct?(code phrase)</t>
 <t id="203">Only Terrans would know this. So I guess I can trust you; you can't be careful enough these days.\n\nI am Lt. Patricia Heywood and I have spent the last few weeks trying to track down the replica of the old Xperimental shuttle. As you might know, the Xperimental was the ship Kyle Brennan was stranded in the Community of planets with during a test of an experimental gateless jumpdrive. I'm not sure if the replica holds any information about this jumpdrive, but we cannot risk that information getting into the hands of the wrong people.</t>
 <t id="204">According to my information, a Teladi by the name of Wegoras Hoaeos Deridos VII got hold of the Xperimental shuttle during a universe-wide treasure hunt. Unfortunately, he is very good at covering his tracks and the only information I was able to find out was the following hint on his current location. I hope it helps you to find him and the shuttle.\n\n[center]\33W"{3219,205}"\33X[/center]\n\nTeladi are generally only interested in Credits, so it should be relatively easy to get the Xperimental from him. If not, your craft is equipped with weapons, right? Show him that there's no profit to be had in dying.\n\nGood luck, Heywood out.</t>

 <t id="500">Ensign Val Jorwan</t>
 <t id="501">Thank you for coming, Sir. I am Ensign Val Jorwan and my job is to monitor the fleet movements of the Boron Kingdom. The Boron believe that I am an Argon liaison officer and that I would...wait, sorry but you are {player.name}, right? The great warrior of Earth? Destroyer of a thousand Argon ships, inventor of the Arachnida-tactics? It's an honour to meet you, Sir; I'm big a fan. I regularly watch the war news, and man I wish I could be part of it. I wonder, if you...\n\n[center][select value='next']Ensign, can we please get on with the mission information?[/select][/center]</t>
 <t id="502">Of course. I am sorry, Sir. You are the first Terran that I have met in ages.\n\nLet's get back to the mission. Being the closest ally of the Argons, the negotiations between the Boron Kingdom and USC high command have been utterly fruitless and so we are expecting the Boron to join the war against us soon. They are already moving their fleets towards the front lines.\n\nAt the moment, however, our attention is focussed on the so-called Xenon HUB - a secret station enabling its owner to redirect gate connections. High command is convinced that the HUB will play a vital role in the upcoming war with the Boron. That is why we must ensure that they won't be able to activate it again.\n\n[center][select value='next']Go on, Ensign.[/select][/center]</t>
 <t id="503">From recent military transmissions, I have discovered that Mahi Ma has been called to the HUB. He is a leading gate scientist and managed to activate the HUB once before; he must not be allowed to reach his destination.\n\nMy current plan is to join Mahi Ma's escort, hijack his ship and take him to Terran territory. The Boron trust me, so I don't expect any additional security measures; taking over his ship should be relative easy with a Transporter Device.\n\nNote that neither we nor the Boron wish to draw attention to Mahi Ma's escort. They expect the help of the Argons in form of additional M3 class ships. So I suggest we give them what they expect. Unfortunately I can't get hold of an appropriate ship myself without arousing suspicion.\n\n[center][select value='next']No problem, Ensign. Stay here and I will bring an Argon M3 to you.[/select][/center]</t>
 <t id="504">Good, you are back, Sir. I was able to identify the route the Boron convoy will be taking. But I am afraid that we won't be able to take over Mahi Ma's ship alone. Fortunately, Lt. Heywood offered her help with this mission.\n\n\n\n[center][select value='next']Ok, go on with the plan.[/select][/center]</t>
 <t id="505">You need to fly to {7,1021110}. There, you will be joining Mahi Ma's escort as additional support through the Pirate sectors, while Lt. Heywood and I follow at a discrete distance. So that the Boron escorts do not shoot you on sight, I was able to get an Argon identification number for you, Sir. You will be identified as Kert Dannar, a member of the Argon Special Task Force 87. You will then escort Mahi Ma until you reach {7,1021310}, where you will destroy all the escort ships, at which point Lt. Heywood and I will regroup with you and board Mahi Ma's TP. Once we are in control, we will have to fly the TP with Mahi Ma aboard to {7,30034}, where a Terran ship is waiting to escort us to friendly territory.</t>
 <t id="506">You need to stay within 15 km of Mahi Ma's ship. Otherwise you risk blowing your cover.</t>
 <t id="507">Sir, where are you going? You need to return immediately or our chance to hijack Mahi Ma's ship will be gone. Jorwan out.</t>
 <t id="508">{player.name}, we successfully managed to board Mahi Ma's ship. He and three of his attendants are fit and well. We need to fly to {7,30034} before more Boron ships show up. Heywood out.</t>
 <t id="509">{player.name}, this is Captain Akeno Kazuko from the Terran destroyer USC Peter Ondronov.\nThank you for your assistance. We took Mahi Ma and his attendants safely on board. We will deliver them to Terran territory.</t>
 <t id="510">{player.name}, this is Captain Brent Pareii from the Terran carrier USC Akira Desu.\n\nBoron forces are stronger than expected. Take this ship to fight against them; it's a bit more suitable than your current one. Captain Pareii out.</t>
 <t id="520">This is Sub-Lieutenant Jorwan. Thanks to our last mission, I've been promoted, so I have you to thank for that, Sir. USC high command was so satisfied with the plan's outcome that from now on I will be involved in higher level war tasks.\n\n[center][select value='next']Congratulations, you earned it.[/select][/center]</t>
 <t id="521">Thank you Sir. My first assignment is to help you in your search for information on the multifunctional ship equipment function. I don't know any technical details, but I know that the Boron are looking into similar technologies and have built a so-called "Headquarters" station, which contains functions strikingly similar to those that were lost. As with all recent military projects, the research is most likely being conducted in {7,1021401}. This sector is usually well-secured, so I doubt that we can simply fly in and download the appropriate data files.\n\nFortunately, the Boron Kingdom has a research agreement with the Argon Federation and they regularly exchange data and technologies; I am sure that the Boron will have granted one or even more of these Headquarters facilities to the Argon, though I have no idea where you might find one. Lt. Kile Kellar has a wider view of galactic events than I do, he might know more about any new stations. You can find him in {7,1020417}.\n\n[center][select value='next']Ok, what else can you tell me?[/select][/center]</t>
 <t id="522">Over recent months, the Boron have undertaken great efforts to encode their research data. While we have the best specialists for decrypting files in the whole universe, even they would need some time to decrypt the HQ data files, time that could be better spent on other things. If you can get information about the Boron encryption algorithm, it would certainly help our researchers.\n\nWhen I monitored Boron fleet movements, I noticed a small Boron group commuting between {7,30011} and {7,1020716} each week. They don't carry any special wares or personnel, so I believe that it is this group that provides the Argon military with the latest information about the latest Boron research results. They probably also have information in their database that could help our scientists to decode their data.\n\nAs we learned from our previous mission, Boron escorts are not exactly what you would call invincible. So it should be easy for you to convince the Boron to provide you with the data, by one means or another.\n\nGood luck Sir, Sub-Lieutenant Jorwan out.</t>
 <t id="523">Sub-Lieutenant Jorwan</t>
 <t id="600">Gululu Ni</t>
 <t id="602">Dear friend and confederate Kert Dannar.\n\nWe are happy and pleased that you choose to join and attend our escort of the smart and brilliant scientist and researcher Mahi Ma through the dangerous and harmful Pirate territories. To thank you we would like to extend an invitation unto you to join the celebrations at the end of our journey.\n\nThere will be cake.\n\nPlease ensure that your distance to Mahi Ma's ship is not greater than 15 km.

 <t id="700">Cpt. Pearle</t>
 <t id="701">Ah you must be {player.name}. I've heard of your great success in the war. I'm Cpt. Pearle and I'm analysing Commonwealth technologies to find out if they are based on Terran developments.\n\nRecently I have heard about a so-called Unfocussed Jumpdrive created by the Goners. From what I have heard, it sounds similar to the Jumpdrive that was built into the Xperimental; enabling jumps to sectors without the need for a jumpgate as target.</t>
 <t id="702">Although we have good relations with the Goners, we were unable to get hold of blueprints for the device or find out where it is being produced. However, knowing the Goners I am sure that they will have information about it stored in their temple somewhere.\n\nWe must get this information. From calling in a few favours, I have been able to obtain access codes to their database. Fly to their temple in {7,30007}, check their database for any relevant information and bring a copy to the Saturn Research Station.\n\nGood luck pilot, Pearle out.</t>

 <t id="804">2. Time changes everything, and so the Goners changed their name in the history of time. What was the name of our organisation before we became the 'Goners'? \n\n\n\n[center][select value='answer1']Earth Seekers[/select][/center]\n[center][select value='answer2']Descendants of Earth[/select][/center]\n[center][select value='answer3']Truth About Earth Foundation[/select][/center]\n[center][select value='answer4']Historians of Terra[/select][/center]</t>
 <t id="805">3. Collecting and spreading text, audio and video data about Earth was one of the main tasks of the Goners. What is the name of the book all Earth related information is stored in?\n\n\n\n[center][select value='answer1']The Book of Earth[/select][/center]\n[center][select value='answer2']The Book of Knowledge[/select][/center]\n[center][select value='answer3']The Book of Enlightenment[/select][/center]\n[center][select value='answer4']The Book of Truth[/select][/center]</t>

 <t id="901">{player.name}, this is Rabeka Braks from the Saturn Research Station.\nThank you for all the data you have managed to gather. With this information, we will hopefully be able to find out how advanced the Commonwealth's research into this field is. Rabeka Braks out.</t>
 <t id="902">{player.name}, this is Rabeka Braks from the Saturn Research station.\nWe were able to process all the data on the HQ you sent us and managed to incorporate it into the first prototype of a Terran multifunctional ship production and equipment station. We hope that a series of these stations will soon be placed throughout Terran territory and help us to win the war against the Commonwealth races.\n\n\Due to the role you played in getting this data, I was advised to grant the first prototype to you. Dock with a TL class ship to the shipyard in {7,1020212} and the station construction kit will be transferred to you. Rabeka Braks out.</t>
 <t id="903">{player.name}, this is Rabeka Braks from the Saturn Research station.\nWe were able to process all the data on the replica of the Xperimental shuttle and the Unfocussed Jumpdrive. It seems that this replica of the Xperimental holds no valuable information; no data pertaining to either the point-to-point jumpdrive or its strong Matter/Antimatter drive has been found in either the ship's databanks or systems. Nevertheless, our engineers were impressed with how well it resembles the original ship. It will serve as a fine exhibit in our Museum of Technology.\n\nAs for the Unfocussed Jumpdrive, it was indeed built from the blueprints of the original Xperimental shuttle's jumpdrive. That is why it also retains most of the flaws of the original. You are still unable to jump to a specific sector; you will end up somewhere else in space instead. The Goners did manage to improve it a little bit however, meaning you can return to your starting sector. We will watch the Goners' progress with this technology; in its current state it is certainly nothing we have to be afraid of, as any advantages given to a ship possessing it are currently rather small. Nevertheless, we have modified a jumpdrive with the Goner Data and it is being transferred to you as we speak. There may be certain aspects of its operation that we have not yet identified; if you notice anything unusual when using the jumpdrive, please report your findings. Rabeka Braks out.</t>
 <t id="904">{player.name}, this is Rabeka Braks from the Saturn Research station.\nThank you for the Xperimental replica. Our engineers will go over every byte in the database to find any valuable information. An automated application for reimbursement of expenses was already sent to the Treasury Department and has been approved. Your expenses incurred in the acquisition of the replica will be reimbursed momentarily. Rabeka Braks out.</t>

 <t id="1000">Lt. Kile Kellar</t>
 <t id="1001">What do you want?</t>
 <t id="1002">Ah you must be {player.name}! The great destroyer of Argon ships, defender of Earth and most importantly thief of my job! Yeah, you heard right. I've spent two years in the Community of Planets looking for HQ technologies they have stolen from us. And how does Command thank me? They give someone else my job and 'promote' me to a scouting officer. Now I can watch the ships fly past outside all day. What a cheek!\n\n[center][select value='next']Please, for the love of Terra I need your help.[/select][/center]</t>
 <t id="1003">Okay, okay. I will help you, for the love of Terra and for my pay check.\n\nRecently there have been rumours that a Teladi corporation, the Nividium Mining and Manufacturing Company \(NMMC\), sold a Boron HQ station to a member of the Argon Special Task Force 87 called Kert Dannar. It's not really clear how NMMC got hold of such a station or why they sold it. However, rumours say that selling the HQ station was just a subtle way for the Teladi government to help the Argons in the Terran War. Fortunately, it is difficult to hide such a unique station, so I know that Kert Dannar built his Headquarters in {7,1023000}.</t>
 <t id="1004">It shouldn't make any difference to our researchers how you get them the necessary data files about the HQ, so scanning it directly is probably just as good as downloading the data somewhere. The security measures of the headquarters will probably prevent any successful long range scan, so you will have to get close to the station. Beware, {7,1023000} is certainly to be well secured, and the members of Task Force 87 are better trained than the rookies you usually fight. Kellar out.</t>

 <t id="102">What's the female get out of it?</t>
 <t id="103">Good looking?</t>
 <t id="104">Your offer angers me. Give me something worth fighting for!</t>
 <t id="105">Done and Done.</t>
 <t id="106">I heard you have a business proposition for me.</t>
 <t id="107">Sounds easy enough. A little too easy ...</t>
 <t id="108">I'll think about it.</t>
 <t id="109">I'm here to inquire about the missing Family Rhy bridle.</t>
 <t id="110">Look buddy, I couldn't care less about some quantum tubes. I'm just looking for her, not your problems.</t>
 <t id="111">Hey wait! What if I get you different parts to meet your deadline? Will you at least tell me where she went?</t>
 <t id="112">I was told you know where I can find Ho t'Sht.</t>
 <t id="113">I thought Split weren't superstitious?</t>
 <t id="114">If you welch on this deal, the only thing you can bet on is that this shipyard will claim more than just your business.</t>
 <t id="115">So, if I accept your offer, what's the catch?</t>
 <t id="116">What do you know about a cursed Split shipyard?</t>
 <t id="117">Fat chance lizard lips. I've traced a Split female grease monkey named Ho t'Sht down to this station and I'm not leaving until you tell me why she's been piling all her credits into your research.</t>
 <t id="118">The way I see it, you have two choices.</t>
 <t id="119">You can accept this research donation of 500,000 credits ...</t>
 <t id="120">... or write an academic paper on the effects of my disintegrator rifle on your lab coat, Egghead.</t>
 <t id="121">Do you know where the Teladi Company main Research and Development Equipment Dock is located?</t>
 <t id="122">What would you do with an overtuned Starburst?</t>
 <t id="123">Setting course for the Trade Dock. Engaging docking computer.</t>
 <t id="124">Well that's creepy. Do you always let the station comm answer your calls?</t>
 <t id="125">You know, speaking of wasting someone's time, you've left quite a few people in the lurch. There's a steaming Teladi researcher, a Family Rhonkar salvager, a Family Rhy General short one bridle ...</t>
 <t id="126">Well that went well ... where did she run off to?</t>
 <t id="127">And what's that Herpy?</t>
 <t id="128">So what happened to the last pilot?</t>
 <t id="129">Of course. I wake up every day wondering if I'll get the unique opportunity to sit in some Teladi.</t>
 <t id="130">You owe me some info.</t>
 <t id="131">Yeah. I've noticed that trend. She loves her engine parts. So what's this got to with the price of Teladianium in Profit Center Alpha?</t>
 <t id="132">Sounds great. Where does she send all the banged up ships for repairs? Her shop has to be around here somewhere.</t>
 <t id="133">Hailing Split TL on transponder frequency 1138 4EB. Foologos Trantaeos VI sent me with some Starburst replacement parts.</t>
 <t id="134">Research? What's this got to ...</t>
 <t id="135">I see you have some brains behind that reported beauty... and a gaping mouth to match! I can see why a spitfire like yourself would baulk about being married off.</t>
 <t id="136">I ... ugh ... so what you're saying is that I've been duped?</t>
 <t id="137">Maybe I can convince one of them to sponsor your research. What can you tell me about each of them?</t>
 <t id="138">That's all I need to know.</t>
 <t id="139">I located Ho t'Sht's Mobile Workshop in Lost Order and convinced her to share research data with you, on the condition that you sponsor her work. What do you say?</t>
 <t id="140">So let's renegotiate this sales pitch. YOU better make ME an offer I'd rather not WANT to refuse, or I'll cut this comm and you won't get squat. Are we understood?</t>
 <t id="141">I've got uniques parked like I'm a bona fide curator.</t>
 <t id="142">Ease back on the throttle there, Hot Stuff. I'll be there in a minute ...</t>
 <t id="143">Alright Spitfire. What's this agenda?</t>
 <t id="144">And then?</t>
 <t id="145">Sounds a bit more difficult ...</t>
 <t id="146">You want me to capture a 'Xenon I' while I'm at it?</t>
 <t id="147">Forget I said anything. Download the engineers' biographies to my ship computer and I'll get cracking.</t>
 <t id="148">I seek a holy trinity of three researchers. You happen to be one. Will you desecrate the holy trinity and dishonour yourself by not joining our engineering trio?</t>
 <t id="149">Sure, sure... how many do you want brought to you? Ten Million? At this point I've got a TL on standby just for uppity scientists like you.</t>
 <t id="150">Not you again!</t>
 <t id="151">We need your assistance building a testbed that won't fly apart the moment we slap a highly volatile M/AM engine on the back. You game?</t>
 <t id="152">You can accept this research donation of 5,000,000 credits ...</t>
 <t id="153">Or I start breaking some eggs ...</t>
 <t id="154">Well that's interesting. I'm looking for an expert in Antimatter Impulse Drives. The question is, what will it take on my end to get you involved with a little side project?</t>
 <t id="155">So you want me to endanger someone else?</t>
 <t id="156">Alright. You have your researchers. Are you sure your TL can hold any more parts with that much ego on board?</t>
 <t id="157">What's that supposed to mean?!</t>
 <t id="158">I've fetched your researchers. I've fetched your parts. Are you going to insult me again?</t>
 <t id="159">Please don't tell me you want a Xenon testbed, anything but a Xenon ship! I'll deliver a Valhalla with a pretty pink bow on it if I have to ...</t>
 <t id="160">It should be. It's been reinforced with Teladianium panelling.\n\nI used to be smart like you until I took a Bug to the face during Operation Final Fury.</t>
 <t id="161">So tell me sparkplug, am I ever going to see that pretty face of yours?</t>
 <t id="162">...</t>
 <t id="163">I have the best salvage insurance the Goners offer. Does that count?</t>
 <t id="164">Gotcha. Lose ship. Pay lots. Fly very very fast. Anything else I should know before I jump into this juiced up jury rigged ship of yours?</t>
 <t id="165">{player.name}: MAYDAY MAYDAY MAYDAY. This is {player.ship.code}. I have experienced a jumpdrive anomaly.</t>
 <t id="166">{player.name}: I have sustained major ship systems damage. I am adrift in uncharted space. Please respond.</t>
 <t id="167">{player.name}: Repeat. MAYDAY MAYDAY MAYDAY. This is {player.ship.code}. Is there anyone out there?</t>
 <t id="168">A funny thing happened on the way to Lost Order ...</t>
 <t id="169">What did YOU do to MY Unfocused Jumpdrive? Something in my cargo bay gave off weird radiation during my jump and the next thing I know is I'm a stranger in a strange land.</t>
 <t id="170">So what did you find out, sparkplug?</t>
 <t id="171">A SLIGHT miscalculation?! How am I going to get another Unfocused Jumpdrive? What about compensation?</t>
 <t id="172">Oh, yeah. I guess that scout ship did scan your NavCom AI, thinking it was a fellow Xenon at first. I'm sure that they didn't share any information of epic consequence ...</t>
 <t id="173">I was wondering if you had a spare Unfocused Jump Drive laying around that I could have. Mine sorta ... broke after flinging me to a Xenon graveyard.</t>
 <t id="174">Yeah. The Xenon used the same technology to blow up Black Hole Sun. How did the crazy Split lady put it? They injected a controlled singularity burst from a gateless jumpdrive into the core of a sun. Fun stuff. Reminds me of this party I once ...</t>
 <t id="175">Oh. Yeah. About that. A Xenon scout scanned my ship's AI, thinking it was a kindred spirit. We sorta swapped business cards while I was in the graveyard. Star charts. Weapons of Mass Destruction. Recipes. I have a copy of the logs if you want to see them.</t>
 <t id="176">So?</t>
 <t id="177">What have the Goners decided to do? I for one welcome our new machine overlords.</t>
 <t id="178">I will defend Earth with my last breath!</t>
 <t id="179">Sorry, not my problem.</t>
 <t id="180">Can I get back you to after lunch?</t>
 <t id="181">You WILL listen because I am a Guardian of Earth. And what the Goners have to say may very well save Earth. Now Read. [Transmit Goner Data]</t>
 <t id="182">You WILL listen because I am a member of the Federation Overwatch. And what the Goners have to say may very well save the Federation. Now Read. [Transmit Goner Data]</t>
 <t id="183">Sounds like a really good deal ...</t>
 <t id="184">Get bent.</t>
 <t id="185">Anything for the Family.</t>
 <t id="186">Consider this my hamonjo.</t>
 <t id="187">Sure, I'll backstab interstellar peace for fun and profit.</t>
 <t id="188">The reason why your head is up your bastu is because I told you to get bent twice.</t>
 <t id="189">ENOUGH!</t>
 <t id="190">I've had it up to here with you two! I didn't see the Yaki attacking either the Terran OR the Argon. You wanna know what I saw?</t>
 <t id="191">I saw humans fighting humans, petty squabbling that has gone on for thousands of years! NO MORE! You wanna know WHY?</t>
 <t id="192">Because there's something just a few sectors away ... something that is a hundred more times efficent at killing humans than any three of you ... Terran ... Argon ... Beryll ... combined ... AND IT IS HERE!</t>
 <t id="193">Not only is it here, but it can't be reasoned with, it can't be negotiated with, and it absolutely WILL NOT STOP until every planet and sun in our universe is DEAD.</t>
 <t id="194">So go ahead and let these ceasefire talks fail. Because if they do, neither of you are going to have a home to go back to.\n\nNow if you exuse me, I'm going to risk my life for Sol AND Sonra, because neither of you will ...</t>

 <t id="510">[yellow]Strong Arms[/yellow]\n\n[white]What they are after[/white]: Speed, Speed and more Speed.

 <t id="513">Beryll</t>
 <t id="514">[yellow]Beryll arm of the Yaki Syndicate[/yellow]\n\n[white]What they are after:[/white] Whatever it is, it's probably related to either expanding their illegal technology markets or something equally dubious.\n\n[white]What {actor.name@L2M023.Split Scientist} would get if the Beryll sponsored her research:[/white] Any technology or service that would be hard to acquire through normal channels would be easy to obtain through Beryll markets.\n\n[white]What {player.name} would get out of the deal:[/white] Shady Business.

It matters not.\n\n[white]{player.name}:[/white] And where should I inquire to the various factions?\n\n[white]{actor.name@L2M023.Split Scientist}:[/white] Well Strong Arms and Jonferco both have sedentary Headquarters. While the Beryll do cavort with the Yaki, they tend to be quite mobile. I suspect they will solicit you. Now fly you fool! As a human once said, trouble springs from idleness, and grievous toil from needless ease.</t>

 <t id="517">First and foremost, we must cultivate the finest experts in specialized engineering fields: Shielding, Structure, and finally Propulsion.</t>
 <t id="518">Then we must acquire the appropriate Commonwealth and Terran parts to build the prototype M/AM ramjet engine.</t>
 <t id="519">Finally, we must acquire a testbed frame to install the prototype M/AM ramjet into.</t>
 <t id="520">Hmmm ... now that you mention it a Xenon testbed ...</t>
 <t id="521">The Yaki are going for {actor.name@L2M023.The Vault Researcher}! Get them before they get her!</t>
 <t id="522">I'm for one stunned that our universe can withstand the zero point field between your ears.</t>
 <t id="523">It means you are well suited for mindless tasks, such as getting an arbitrary amount of arbitrary goods. Now I'll let each of our researchers detail the extensive list we will require ...</t>
 <t id="524">That depends if you continue to open your mouth. Now, lest we waste another second on these frivolous discourses, we require the final part of this endeavour, the testbed.</t>
 <t id="525">Consider yourself fortunate that I have little experience with modifying Xenon ship chassis. No. To facilitate ease of modification, we will be working with a known quantity, the Split Heavy Dragon. And make sure it has a Teladianium coloured bow on it. For Yalos.</t>
 <t id="526">My apologies. It's a little inside joke between {actor.name@L2M023.Family Rhonkar Salvager} and myself. We always joked that our humble exploits would create another Dragon Incident.\n\nBut I digress. It will take some time to modify the heavy corvette chassis. Amuse yourself somehow. We will be in need of your breakneck piloting skills sometime within the next six to twelve hours.</t>
 <t id="527">So tell me, fly boy. Are you ready to test the limits of that thick cranium of yours?\n\n[center][select value='accept']{3223,160}[/select][/center]</t>
 <t id="528">If you come back alive I may consider it, like I would consider feeding my pet Chelt. You two have so much in common. Remind me to introduce you two sometime.</t>
 <t id="529">On to more relevant matters, are you insured against unintentional M/AM reactor breaches?</t>
 <t id="530">Well that's good, because if you lose this ship we are going to charge you 25M credits. If you don't have 25M credits in your bank account, at least fly a fast ship. Something faster than our lasers.</t>
 <t id="531">Loli Po has calibrated the engine but noticed some minor, temporary power fluctuations from the reactor core. Please do try to take it easy.</t>
 <t id="532">You may have noticed that I have taken the liberty of installing my latest NavCom AI into the testbed. Please report on any minor bugs in the software you may encounter. Chi Nu t'Pst has also integrated his experimental Detector technology into its design, fuzzy dice optional. I may have forgotten to mention, we'll be monitoring things from minimum safe distance, just in case ...\n\nDon't worry. I'll be fine.\n\nIt looks like the prototype's M/AM core readings are all nominal. Follow us to back to {sector.name@L2M023.Lost Order}.</t>
 <t id="533">Well you did it. You managed to lose a 25M credit prototype. You are aware that this puts us another 12 months behind schedule? Perhaps I will assign you a task more fitting of your apparent skills, like being an Akuma's figurehead.</t>
 <t id="534">What did YOU do to MY ship? Did you really become an Akuma figurehead? You jumped out of Family Pride and disappeared.</t>
 <t id="535">Enough of your insane prattle. Transmit your flight logs and data core.</t>
 <t id="536">This is ... incredible! You may have very well found the cradle of Xenon development! And the legacy code, astonishing AI recursion, really.\n\nQuite close to the original directive ... goal drift considering ... I know several entities that would like to look at this source ...</t>
 <t id="537">And the schematics and theoretical workings of the fabled Xenon M0 star destroyer ... ingenious! Using a controlled singularity burst from a gateless jumpdrive to destabilize the core of a sun ... brilliant!\n\nI bet Family Rhy's generals would simply massacre each other for this data ...</t>
 <t id="538">Which may explain why your Unfocused Jumpdrive, based on a Xenon prototype from the X-Shuttle, interacted with the new ramjet design ... slight miscalculation really ... mixing quantum wave form collapse and annihilation of anti-matter ... I'm surprised your particles didn't invert their polarity ...</t>
 <t id="539">Simple creature. The privilege of being my test subje ... err pilot, should be enough compensation for anyone. Still ... the ship is trashed and is of no use to me.\n\nKeep it. I have much better designs in mind integrating the schematics you shared with the Xenon.</t>

 <t id="616">The corvette's reactor is unstable. You may be able to track it by radiation signature if you get within 5km.

 <t id="691">This appears to be the wreck of a massive ship. From the design and complexity, the remains are clearly an evolutionary bridge between the Second Terraformer Fleet of ancient Earth and the Xenon of modern day.\n\nAnalysis indicates destruction by supernova prior to 742 NT when a more advanced design destroyed the star of Black Hole Sun using unfocused jump drive technology. This sector's black hole seems to be the failed result of one such Xenon experiment.\n\n Schematics downloaded and archived. More data required for further extrapolation.</t>
 <t id="692">You have downloaded what remains from the barely functional CPU core. Most of the legacy code is corrupt, but it appears to contains copies of both the original shutdown codes transmitted to the Second Terraformer fleet from Earth as well as the modified version transmitted by Dr Marteen Winters that spawned the Xenon.\n\nSince the base code is a hybrid between Terraformer and Xenon, a talented AGI developer might be able to reverse engineer it to seize control of both the Xenon and the Beryll Assembler Drone Fleet into an unstoppable gestalt, or shut them down entirely.\n\nLegacy code downloaded and archived. It is recommended that you return to known space for more extensive repairs before Xenon reinforcements arrive. You may be able to find Jump Drive Components and other spare parts among the Xenon wreckage scattered about the system.\n\n[center][select value='accept']{3223,693}[/select][/center]</t>

 <t id="240263">\033GThis will cost the Corporation {value.formatted@L2M024.FighterCost} credits to set up, but will also benefit other\033X\n\033Gbusinesses using this route, increasing our standing with them.\033X</t>
 <t id="240264">\033GWill only cost {value.formatted@L2M024.MercCost} credits, but this is per trade convoy and it could take a while\033X\n\033Gbefore we deter the Pirates.  Also there will be little benefit to other businesses.\033X</t>
 <t id="240265">\033GWon't cost us a credit in outlay, however, it will increase delivery times which may not go down well\033X\n\033Gwith our customers.\033X</t>
 <t id="240266">\033GAlthough a sizable outlay, the interest payments will be regular income, plus they will use us as a\033X\n\033Gsupplier and may build up other useful contacts.\033X</t>
 <t id="240267">\033GIt may split their loyalties if they have to borrow from two sources, or they may go somewhere else for\033X\n\033Gthe money, but we can't afford to lend the full amount at the moment.\033X</t>
 <t id="240268">\033GMoney is tight, and lending money for a business that may benefit us in the long term is just too much\033X\n\033Gof a risk at the moment.\033X</t>
 <t id="240269">\033GHigh initial outlay at {value.formatted@L2M024.MineAmount} credits, but we can guarantee production,\033X\n\033Gplus any surplus can be sold or used elsewhere.\033X</t>
 <t id="240270">\033GLower start-up cost of {value.formatted@L2M024.MinerCost} credits, but potentially higher maintenance\033X\n\033Gcosts if miners are damaged or lost in the asteroid fields, could also lead to erratic delivery schedules.\033X</t>
 <t id="240271">\033GNo set up costs that would help a smaller business, but we would take a large cut in the profits from the\033X\n\033Gjob and be reliant on someone else meeting deadlines.\033X</t>
 <t id="240272">\033GHopefully the money we save from reducing escorts for our convoys, and being able to guarantee delivery\033X\n\033Gtimes for these routes will outweigh the cost.  I just hope other businesses don't find out we made this deal.\033X</t>
 <t id="240273">\033GDeals like this seem good at first, but the price has a habit of escalating.  We'll just have to monitor the\033X\n\033Gsituation and provide extra fighter cover or re-route the convoys if necessary.\033X</t>
 <t id="240274">\033GPay the workers what they want, we can't afford for this factory to be offline at the moment.\033X\n\033GHowever there is a chance that staff at our other factories would see it as an easy option for a pay rise.\033X</t>
 <t id="240275">\033GExplain to them we can't afford pay rises at the moment, but offer them profit based bonuses.\033X\n\033GAlthough we could end up paying them more in the long run, the extra profit will offset the payments.\033X</t>
 <t id="240276">\033GWe simply don't have the money to spare, they either get back to work or be out of a job.\033X\n\033GIf we don't take the hard line now we'll end up with all our factories on strike for more money.\033X</t>
 <t id="240277">\033GThis will cost us {value.formatted@L2M024.GlassCost} credits to implement across all our factories.\033X\n\033GThere will also be ongoing costs for replacements, but we will not be liable for future accidents.\033X</t>
 <t id="240278">\033GInitially only half the price of supplying safety glasses, the long term cost could be a lot more.\033X\n\033GAs we open more factories, more training sessions will need to be arranged for the new staff.\033X</t>
 <t id="240279">\033GThese incidents are very rare, and paying the occasional compensation claim should work out\033X\n\033Gcheaper in the long run.  If we buy them safety glasses this time, next time it will be a finger...\033X</t>
 <t id="240280">\033GIf we lend them {value.formatted@L2M024.BailOut} credits it will keep the business running for now.  However, we may\033X\n\033Gbe throwing good money after bad, and end up back to where we started.\033X</t>
 <t id="240281">\033GNot the cheapest option at {value.formatted@L2M024.BuyOut} credits, but at least we will be in control and could\033X\n\033Gensure that our contracts are filled first.  Presuming it's not a total lost cause.\033X</t>
 <t id="240282">\033GA no cost solution, however it may take some time to find another supplier and we run the risk of\033X\n\033Glosing our customer if there is too much disruption in the deliveries.\033X</t>
 <t id="240283">\033GI know money is tight at the moment, but we must do what we can to help those in need.\033X</t>
 <t id="240284">\033GSend them {value.formatted@L2M024.PartReliefCost} credits, I know it's not what they're asking, you'll\033X\n\033Ghave to explain our current financial situation, and point out that something is better than nothing.\033X</t>
 <t id="240285">\033GSounds harsh, but at the moment that money could be the difference between staying afloat or going\033X\n\033Gbankrupt.  If we go bankrupt it will be the last cause we help, but if we turn the business round we will\033X\n\033Gbe able to help more in the future.\033X</t>
 <t id="240286">\033GWe cannot risk that this bill being passed.  The lobbyist is our best chance at getting it thrown\033X\n\033Gout.  Paying the lobbyist what he wants will cost us {value.formatted@L2M024.LobbyCost} credits, but has the highest chance\033X\n\033Gthat the bill we be rejected.\033X</t>
 <t id="240287">\033GTeladi understand money, {value.formatted@L2M024.BribeCost} credits in bribes is a lot less than the lobbyist is asking.\033X\n\033GThere's a chance the bill will fail.

 <t id="240288">\033GWe have to hope the  Teladi commissioners do the right thing.  It won't cost us any money,\033X\n\033Gbut if the bill passes there will be more taxes to pay.\033X</t>

 <t id="240290">\033GAdvertising is necessary, but we cannot afford a big campaign right now. {value.formatted@L2M024.SmallCampaign} credits\033X\n\033Gwill get us a few radio commercials and news service ads that will get our name out there.\033X\n\033GIt will give us an idea of what form of advertising will work best for us.\033X</t>
 <t id="240291">\033GWe don't have the money to spare for an advertising campaign right now. We'll have to rely on our\033X\n\033Gexisting customers spreading the word for us. We can always look at starting a campaign later\033X\n\033Gwhen money isn't so tight.\033X</t>

 <t id="240326">{3224,240107}, Personal Log:\n\nDate: 767-12-20\n\nI have stumbled upon some old research that leads me to believe there may be a way to detect inactive jump gates that aren't connected to the gate network. I'm going to have to look further into this.\n\n\nDate: 768-02-03\n\nI've managed to get a job at Terracorp HQ, as I think there may be people here who can help with my research. Ideally I would have liked to have gone to the Terrans, as they recently built a jump gate, however with this war going on they probably wouldn't be too receptive to a Boron nosing around...\n\n\nDate: 768-03-12\n\nAt last some progress, there are certain materials used in the gates that cause certain crystals to resonate. I have built a rudimentary scanner, but in order to fine tune it I'm going to have to try and take a look at the Terran's gate in Neptune.</t>
 <t id="240327">{3224,240107}, Personal Log:\n\nDate: 768-03-18\n\nThat was close. A couple of tense days in Terran space dodging their patrols. Managed to get some useful readings from their gate.\nLapse in concentration as I was flying through Asteroid Belt, and nearly flew straight into one of their patrols, they chased me across three sectors before I found an Argon task force to divert their attention.\n\nI am not sure how I got out alive, but managed to limp to PTNI Headquarters, where I could put my ship in for repair. Dread to think how much it's going to cost to get it fixed...\n\n\nDate: 768-03-24\n\nThe ship is repaired, and with the downtime managed to fine tune my scanner. It is picking up a faint signal, so I am heading out to see where it will lead me.</t>
 <t id="240328">{3224,240107}, Personal Log:\n\nDate: 768-03-29\n\nI am currently holed up in Nyana's Hideout, my readings have had me backtracking towards the war zone. An area I'm not too keen on revisiting after my recent experience there. However I feel I am close to finding something, so I'm going to wait until the Argon make a push forward and hopefully it will be a little safer.\n\n\nDate: 768-04-10\n\nAt last the Argons have gone on the offensive, and I'm on the move again.\nMy suspicions were correct as my readings have led me out West in Heretics End, but there's nothing here apart from an asteroid though my readings indicate there should be an inactive gate.\nThere's no point hanging around here any longer as I don't have the equipment to deal with an asteroid.</t>
 <t id="240329">{3224,240107}, Personal Log:\n\nDate: 768-04-19\n\nAn uneventful few days. Thankfully my journey out of the war zone was a little less fraught than before.\n\nStopped in PTNI Headquarters to order some mining equipment, and I'm now on my way down to Freedom's Reach to see Rurandis before I head back to Heretic's End. It may be an idea to leave her a copy of these logs just in case.\n\n\n[center][select value='Accept']   OK   [/select][/center]</t>

 <t id="240402">(IM){3224,240401}\nHowever, as we have now stabilized our delivery schedule, one of our customers has increased their regular order, which has given a small boost to the Corporations reputation.</t>
 <t id="240403">(IM)The expense of setting up fighter patrol to protect our convoys is paying off.  Our losses are now minimal, our customers are happy as their deliveries are getting through on time, and other businesses using that route are very grateful.</t>
 <t id="240404">(IM)The factory we lent the money for is now up and running, they seem to be doing a good job.\nNot only are they prompt with the loan repayments, but they have also sent some business our way.</t>
 <t id="240405">(IM)Our {lookup.type.name@{value@L2M024.MineralWare}} is up and running, and the first deliveries have been made.  It looks like we may also have found someone to sell any surplus to.\nThis has given the Corporation a major boost.</t>
 <t id="240406">(IM)So far Duke's have held up their end of the bargain with protection payments still at the agreed level.  Unfortunately some local businesses found out that I made a deal with the Pirates, and a few contracts have been lost.</t>
 <t id="240407">(IM)So far so good, Duke's haven't tried increasing the protection payments, and it seems that our dealings haven't been discovered by the local businesses.\nI think we may have gotten away with it this time.</t>
 <t id="240408">(IM)This is worse than I'd expected.  Duke's are now demanding increased payments for the protection, on top of this several local businesses have gotten wind that I made a deal with the Pirates, and a few contracts have been lost.</t>
 <t id="240409">(IM)It is as we feared, Duke's are now demanding more money for the protection, I hope it doesn't escalate too much.  On the plus side, there has been no fallout from local businesses related to this matter.</t>
 <t id="240410">(IM)Production at the factory has now been shut down.  Hopefully we will be able to get it up and running again when our situation improves.</t>
 <t id="240411">(IM)The Mercenaries are performing well, and our convoys are now getting through safely.  We have also been able to offer a small business the chance to add their two ships to our convoy giving them protection as well.</t>
 <t id="240412">(IM)Our convoys are now meeting their delivery schedule, thanks to the protection the Mercenaries are providing.</t>
 <t id="240413">(IM)The loan applicant accepted our offer of 50% of the amount they were after, and have started to make regular payments.  They have also managed to send a small amount of business our way, not as much as I'd like, but I suppose they have their other backers to consider as well.</t>
 <t id="240414">(IM)Our offer of 50% was turned down by the loan applicant, and they went elsewhere for the money.  Unfortunately they decided to set up near to one of our factories and have managed to lure some contracts away from us.</t>
 <t id="240415">(IM)The mobile miners have been getting the job done.  There has been the inevitable repair bills, but nothing major so far, and they've mostly been on time with their deliveries.\nMy concern is, when they need to move further afield to mine the {lookup.type.name@{value@L2M024.MineralWare}} it may take them longer to make the delivery runs and the customer will not be happy with more than the occasional late delivery.  I suppose all we can do is monitor the situation.</t>
 <t id="240416">(IM)It appears that Duke's didn't like being turned down.  They hit us, hard, we lost an entire convoy and subsequently the contract due to non-delivery.\nThankfully that was the only convoy we had operating in that area at the time.  But we will definitely need some form of protection if we need to run convoys there in the future.</t>
 <t id="240417">(IM)Surprisingly there seem to have been no reprisals from turning down Duke's offer of protection.  It may be worth seeing if we can pull a couple of fighters from other escort groups to give our convoys in that area a little more protection, just in case...</t>
 <t id="240418">(IM)The station has been sold, which has given a much needed boost to the Corporations finances and reputation.  Unfortunately it will make it very difficult to get back into that potentially lucrative market in that area.</t>
 <t id="240419">(IM)I have managed to rearrange the delivery schedule with our customers to take into account the longer route. We will be making slightly larger deliveries each run so their supply isn't interrupted.</t>
 <t id="240420">(IM)Unfortunately, not all our customers were happy with the longer delivery times, and as a result have switched suppliers.</t>
 <t id="240421">(IM)The individual after a start-up loan was not happy that we turned them down.\nThey have set themselves up in direct competition with one of our factories, and have managed to lure away several of our customers</t>
 <t id="240422">(IM)Sub contracting the job seems to have worked out well.  The major Corporation is happy their {lookup.type.name@{value@L2M024.MineralWare}} is being delivered.  The company we are using are grateful for the regular business, and we're making a little money out of it without spending a credit.</t>
 <t id="240423">(IM)The strike has been called off, and production has resumed at our factory.  So far there has been no copy cat strikes from our other stations, so hopefully this is an end to the matter.</t>
 <t id="240424">(IM)The strike has been called off, and production has resumed at our factory.  Unfortunately word of the payoff reached several of our other stations, who threatened similar action.  It ended up costing us {value.formatted@L2M024.StrikePay} credits to resolve the situation across the Corporation.</t>
 <t id="240425">(IM)The work force is mostly happy with their new safety glasses, and with us for our concern for their well-being.  There have been a few complaints about having to wear the safety glasses, but they have been told the decision to wear them is up to the individual and the Corporation will not be liable for any claims after suitable protection was provided.</t>
 <t id="240426">(IM)The business we bailed out is slowly managing to turn things around, and even managed to start repaying the loan.  As a result of us lending them the money they have promised to make our contract a priority, so at least our customers are happy.</t>
 <t id="240427">(IM)Not a good result.  The individual took the bail out money and did a runner...\nI don't think they will get far, as I have heard of at least three contracts that have been taken out on them by disgruntled creditors.\nIt has however left us out of pocket.  In the meantime the stations management team have arranged financial backing to take over the station, so hopefully it will be business as usual soon.  I did have to offer our customer a discount on their next few deliveries to placate them, and whilst not overly happy, understand the situation and have allowed us a little time to resume normal deliveries.</t>
 <t id="240428">(IM)Well that went down well, the strike has been called off, and already there is an improvement in productivity.</t>
 <t id="240429">(IM)The strikers didn't like that idea.  In the end I managed to settle for a quarter of what they wanted, but had to promise to sit down and review their pay in two mazuras time.  At least the factory is running again for now.</t>
 <t id="240430">(IM)The safety training is under way, some of the workers are complaining about having to spend a day sat in a classroom, but they'll just have to put up with it.  I also found out that there are some businesses that will take a company's safety policy into account when deciding on whether to do business with them, so this should help us out.</t>
 <t id="240431">(IM)The station owner was not happy at being bought out, but at the end of the day business is business.  If we can turn things around quickly enough with the station, we may even manage to retain some of his other customers.</t>
 <t id="240432">(IM)The threat of losing their jobs was enough to get the strikers back to work, but they're not happy.  We will have to watch the factory closely as I don't think that's an end to the matter.</t>
 <t id="240433">(IM)The threat of losing their jobs didn't work, so I ended up sacking a third of the work force,  As a result production is down and staff morale is at an all time low.  On top of this we now need to recruit and train new workers, not good at all.</t>
 <t id="240434">(IM)The compensation has been paid, hopefully there won't be too many more of these little accidents.</t>
 <t id="240435">(IM)I have found a new supplier, unfortunately we won't be making as much profit with this one, but at least they appear to be financially stable.</t>
 <t id="240436">(IM)Finding a new supplier took longer than I hoped.  To make matters worse, one of our competitors took over the bankrupt business and taken some of our business.</t>
 <t id="240437">(IM)The relief payment has been sent.  Thankfully conditions on the planet surface seem to be improving.</t>
 <t id="240438">(IM)Our donation was graciously received, though I think they were a little disappointed with the amount.  I did explain that the Corporation is having some financial troubles at the moment, and it was the best we could do.</t>
 <t id="240439">(IM)Well that didn't go down to well.  They just couldn't seem to understand that sending aid money at the moment, whilst helping those in need on the planet could be at the expense of hundreds of jobs if the Corporation went bankrupt.</t>
 <t id="240440">(IM)Employing the services of a lobbyist seems to have paid off.  The bill for higher sector taxes has been rejected, so we should recover the cost over time.</t>
 <t id="240441">(IM)So much for that!!  I don't know what we were paying that lobbyist for, as the bill got passed.  So not only have we had to pay for their 'services', but now we have an extra {value.formatted@L2M024.TaxCost} credits in taxes to find every wozura.</t>
 <t id="240442">(IM)Our advertising campaign is well under away, and is already showing returns.  It was certainly a good idea.</t>
 <t id="240443">(IM)The article has been released, and they portrayed us in a good light, both our reputation and business have benefitted from this.</t>
 <t id="240444">(IM)Letting the journalist into the factories wasn't such a good idea.  They focussed on all the negative aspects, which has affected both the business and the Corporations reputation.</t>
 <t id="240445">(IM)The quality problems have now been fixed at {object.name@L2M024.ProblemStation} and our customers seem happy.  In addition the news service did a follow up article, praising us for responding quickly and in a positive way to the issues they raised.</t>
 <t id="240446">(IM)Well that went rather smoothly, a few backhanders to some of the Commissioners was enough to sway the vote, and the bill has been rejected.</t>
 <t id="240447">(IM)Bad news I'm afraid...   I think I managed to find the only Teladi with a conscious when it comes to money.  Worse still they decided to let the public know what we were attempting to do, which hasn't been good for business, on top of that there are extra taxes to pay as the bill was passed.</t>
 <t id="240448">(IM)Our small advertising campaign is showing some returns on the investment, nothing as grand as a full blown campaign would, but we can always increase the budget when finances allow.</t>
 <t id="240449">(IM)Well the journalist never bothered to write an article on us the end, so no fallout from refusing them access to our factories.</t>
 <t id="240450">(IM)The journalist didn't like being refused access to our factories, they wrote a scathing article saying we obviously had sub-standard working conditions and poor quality control, which has had an impact on the business.</t>
 <t id="240451">(IM)No customers complained - no effect on business.</t>
 <t id="240452">(IM)There's been a few customer complaints, and one has taken their business elsewhere.</t>
 <t id="240453">(IM)The bill got passed, no surprise there.  I just hope they do something useful with extra money, like increase sector security, which would be of benefit to us and our customers.</t>
 <t id="240454">(IM)I can't believe it!!  They actually threw out the bill.  No expense, and no extra taxes to pay, a win win situation for us.</t>
 <t id="240455">(IM)We've seen a slight increase in business from our customer's recommendations, but nothing like what we need.  We will have to make sure we start some form of advertising campaign as soon as we have some spare money.</t>
 <t id="240456">(IM)We won our legal battle and the news service has been forced to print an apology as well as pay compensation.</t>
 <t id="240457">(IM)We lost the law suit against the news service, which has damaged our reputation even more, not to mention all the legal fees.</t>
 <t id="240458">(IM)It looks like the law suit is going to turn into a lengthy case, as long as we win in the end, we'll get our legal costs back, but it would probably have been cheaper to fix the problem in the first place.</t>

 <t id="240611">One of our stations in {sector.name@L2M024.RepSector} is losing money due to poor supply lines, there is also another business in the area producing the same goods.\nWe have three options to hopefully resolve the situation, but I'm not sure of the best course of action.</t>
 <t id="240612">One of our trade routes is taking our freighters though sectors frequented by Pirates. We are losing freight, and occasionally ships due to our attacks.\nA decision needs to be made to protect our pilots.</t>
 <t id="240613">An individual has approached me looking to set a {lookup.type.name@{value@L2M024.LoanWare}} business, and is looking to borrow {value.formatted@L2M024.LoanAmount} to get started.\nWhat are your thoughts on this?</t>
 <t id="240614">We have been offered a contract by one of the major Corporations to supply them with {value.formatted@L2M024.MineralAmount} units of {lookup.type.name@{value@L2M024.MineralWare}} every Wozura.\nTurning it down isn't an option as there are far too many benefits to be gained.  What we need to decide is the best way to meet their requirements.</t>
 <t id="240615">The workers at our {17,{lookup.type.name.textid@{value@L2M024.StrikeStationType}}} have gone out on strike, demanding more pay and shorter hours.  I'm going to need some help to settle the dispute.</t>
 <t id="240616">The eye of one of our employees was injured by falling iron filings in our {17,{lookup.type.name.textid@{value@L2M024.StrikeStationType}}}.  We have no choice but to pay their claim for {value.formatted@L2M024.Compensation} credits compensation.  However, we need to take action to prevent more cases like this happening?</t>
 <t id="240617">One of our Sub Contractors is on the verge of going bankrupt, and have come for us for help.  Unfortunately we were using them to supply one of our major contracts, so we are going to have to take some action to remedy the situation.</t>
 <t id="240618">A natural disaster has struck on one of the planets in the {sector.name@L2M024.DisasterSector} system.  Local businesses have been asked to send aid, and they are requesting {value.formatted@L2M024.ReliefCost} credits from us to aid the relief effort.</t>
 <t id="240619">I have been approached by a representative of Duke's Buccaneers, who is offering protection for our convoys travelling through certain sectors at a cost of {value.formatted@L2M024.ProtectionCost} credits.\nMaking any deal with Pirates is rarely a good idea, but refusing them could prove costly.  I'd like your thoughts on the matter.</t>
 <t id="240620">The Teladi Commerce Commission is going to vote on a draft bill to increase the sector usage taxes for several businesses. If this bill passes, we will have to pay a lot more taxes than before.\nA lobbyist however has offered their help in this situation.  What should we do?</t>
 <t id="240621">At present we are relying mainly on word of mouth from our current customers to generate new business. If we want to get more customers, advertising might be an idea. Should we increase our budget for advertising?</t>
 <t id="240622">A journalist of the famous business magazine "Companies of the Universe" has contacted us. They want to write an article about us for their next issue. This would mean a visit some of our factories. What should we do?</t>
 <t id="240623">A Local News Service has reported quality failures of our {lookup.type.name@{object.products.random@{object@L2M024.ProblemStation}}} that are produced at our {object.name@L2M024.ProblemStation}. What should we do?</t>
 <t id="241000">You wanted to see me?</t>
 <t id="241001">OK, I'm listening.</t>
 <t id="241002">What sort of trouble are we talking about?</t>
 <t id="241003">That sounds rather more than a little trouble to me.\nCan you not sell off some shares or something to raise some working capital?</t>
 <t id="241004">Sounds like you have very few options, but you obviously have some sort of plan otherwise you wouldn't have contacted me.</t>
 <t id="241005">And I presume you want me to act as this intermediary?</t>
 <t id="241006">So how does this work? I'm sure you understand that I need to know exactly what I'm getting myself into before I can agree to anything.</t>
 <t id="241007">And where do I find a Corporate Accountant?</t>
 <t id="241008">OK, I'll go and talk to them, and will let you know when I've made my decision.</t>
 <t id="241009">Look, I'm going to have to give this some thought and get back to you.</t>
 <t id="241010">OK, I'll see what I can do.</t>
 <t id="241011">You wanted to see me?</t>
 <t id="241012">You'd best show me what it is.</t>
 <t id="241013">{param@Option1}</t>
 <t id="241014">{param@Option2}</t>
 <t id="241015">{param@Option3}</t>
 <t id="241019">I need to see the accounts for {param@CorpNameText} Corporation.</t>
 <t id="241020">I've just been speaking to {param@CorpActorText} from {param@CorpNameText} Corporation, and they were hoping I may be able to help them, but suggested I talked to a Corporate Accountant first.</t>
 <t id="241021">So is there anything that can be done?</t>
 <t id="241022">OK, before we go any further, is there any chance of seeing what the current state of affairs is?</t>
 <t id="241023">There's not a lot of money in the bank there.</t>
 <t id="241024">Tell me about the reputation.</t>
 <t id="241025">Makes sense. So how would one go about raising the reputation?</t>
 <t id="241026">So, basically help others to help yourself?</t>
 <t id="241027">Any information about the shares.</t>
 <t id="241028">So the 10% the owner has at the moment isn't good at all.</t>
 <t id="241029">How would we go about recovering the shares? Presumably there is some record of who owns them?</t>
 <t id="241030">And then I suppose it's a case of convincing them to part with them?</t>
 <t id="241031">Anything else I need to know?</t>
 <t id="241032">That's making this proposal a little more tempting. As the better the Corporation does the more I benefit.</t>
 <t id="241033">So, if for example I helped out {param@CorpActorText}, got the Corporations reputation to a respectable level, and recovered most of the shares, I would have a sizable stake in the Corporation and be in a strong position to take ownership of it?</t>
 <t id="241034">Definitely, now you mentioned something earlier about a way to raise some working capital for the Corporation, could you tell me about that?</t>
 <t id="241035">But without any shares available, and very few assets for collateral the Corporation owner can do very little in this case...</t>
 <t id="241042">Thank you, for all your help.</t>
 <t id="241043">Can I see the accounts again for {param@CorpNameText} Corporation?</t>
 <t id="241044">Thank you.</t>
 <t id="241046">That's all for now.</t>
 <t id="241047">Right, I've talked to the accountant and decided to help you out.</t>
 <t id="241048">So, where do we get started?</t>
 <t id="241049">OK, I'll get on it.</t>
 <t id="241050">I just hope I don't end up regretting the decision I've made...</t>
 <t id="241051">I recently acquired at auction some old papers belonging to Molo Do. Amongst them was probably the last thing they ever wrote, your name was mentioned in it, and as suggested here I am.</t>

 <t id="241061">I think I understand that.</t>
 <t id="241062">Thanks again.</t>
 <t id="241063">You have some questions for me?</t>
 <t id="241064">I was actually looking for it, sort of.</t>
 <t id="241065">I recently came across some logs from a Boron called Molo Do...</t>
 <t id="241066">found a way to locate gates not connected to the network. He discovered the gate in Heretic's End, or at least the asteroid it was inside. Unfortunately he was killed before he could prove his theory.</t>
 <t id="241067">There's no event horizon and it doesn't lead anywhere. Otherwise it looks in excellent condition.</t>
 <t id="241068">And where do we find one of those? As far as I know Molo Do's research died with him.</t>
 <t id="241069">Outside the connected Universe...? Would you care to explain that one?</t>
 <t id="241070">OK, but those gates are rather large, will we get one on a ship?</t>
 <t id="241071">Alright, I'll be back soon.</t>
 <t id="241072">Not so wild apparently. He {3224,241066}</t>
 <t id="241073">You mean like the destroyed gates in Brennan's Triumph and Belt of Aguilar?</t>
 <t id="241074">More than likely.  Any way he was the one that {3224,241066}</t>
 <t id="241075">You mean like the destroyed gates in Heretic's End and Brennan's Triumph?</t>
 <t id="241076">You need some resources collecting for the gate?</t>
 <t id="241077">You'd better show me what you need.</t>
 <t id="241078">Nothing too difficult there, I'll get on it.</t>
 <t id="241079">Is that all you need?</t>
 <t id="241080">What is it?</t>
 <t id="241081">Never heard of them, let alone seen any for sale.</t>
 <t id="241082">So where am I going to find them?</t>
 <t id="241083">And they'll sell me these crystals?</t>
 <t id="241084">I think I get the picture, I'll see what I can do.</t>
 <t id="241085">The gate is ready then?</t>
 <t id="241086">So what's the plan?</t>
 <t id="241087">Void of Opportunity? Isn't that a Pirate sector?</t>
 <t id="241088">OK, that makes sense. What do you need me to do?</t>
 <t id="241089">I think I can manage that.</t>
 <t id="241090">Well that was impressive, shame it's not connected to where we hoped, or anywhere in fact...</t>
 <t id="241091">You think that will work?</t>
 <t id="241092">OK, I'll wait to hear from you.</t>

 <t id="241127">I'd like to settle my auction bill.</t>
 <t id="241128">You'd better show me what you need.</t>
 <t id="241131">What do you propose we do?</t>
 <t id="241132">How are we going to do that?</t>
 <t id="241133">No problem, I'll be back shortly.</t>
 <t id="241134">Hello Officer, I have some information you may find useful.</t>
 <t id="241135">I just docked at a station when a pilot there offered me some space fuel, as far as I'm aware, apart from licensed establishments, it's illegal in {param@SectorRace} space.</t>
 <t id="241136">Sure, there he is, he's just leaving that station.</t>
 <t id="241137">What happened?</t>
 <t id="241138">I see.</t>
 <t id="241139">You'll be going after him then?</t>
 <t id="241140">Let's hope someone catches him then.</t>
 <t id="241141">Hi there, I've been told you can help with a problem I have.</t>
 <t id="241142">There's a certain individual we need disposed of.</t>
 <t id="241143">How much is it going to cost me?</t>
 <t id="241144">That's a lot of money.</t>
 <t id="241145">OK, OK, Here's your money, just make sure the job gets done.</t>
 <t id="241146">I'm going to explore my options, I'll get back to you.</t>
 <t id="241147">So what happened?</t>
 <t id="241148">Can you show me where I'm going?</t>
 <t id="241149">We have a deal I suppose.</t>
 <t id="241150">Err... I'm afraid the ship got destroyed.</t>
 <t id="241151">So I can have the shares then?</t>
 <t id="241152">Remind me what it was.</t>
 <t id="241153">I'm not sure about fair, but I'll get your ship.</t>
 <t id="241158">And if things don't turn around?</t>
 <t id="241159">OK, let's do this.</t>
 <t id="241160">You wanted to see me regarding {param@CorpNameText} Corporation?</t>
 <t id="241161">So, what does that mean?</t>
 <t id="241162">That is unfortunate, after all the hard work we put in to it.\nSo, what do you need me for?</t>
 <t id="241163">What do you have in mind?</t>
 <t id="241164">Can I see some figures?</t>
 <t id="241165">OK, here's the {param@CorpHQBuyPrice} Credits.</t>
 <t id="241166">I'll have to think about it.</t>
 <t id="241167">Thank you.</t>
 <t id="241168">I'll get back to you.</t>
 <t id="241169">So I hear, though it would have been nice if {param@CorpOwnerName} had given me the option of buying them out after all the help I gave them to turn things round.</t>
 <t id="241170">So what do you want from me?</t>
 <t id="241171">So what's the deal?</t>
 <t id="241172">I believe you have a Corporation Headquarters for me?</t>
 <t id="241173">There are choices? What are they?</t>
 <t id="241174">I'll take Option 1, the OTAS style.</t>
 <t id="241175">I'll take Option 2, the NMMC style.</t>
 <t id="241176">I'll take Option 3, the Strong Arms style.</t>
 <t id="241177">I'm going to go and have a closer look at these stations, and see which I prefer.</t>
 <t id="241178">I look forward to hearing from you.</t>
 <t id="241179">I'll be back shortly.</t>
 <t id="241180">What is it you're offering?</t>
 <t id="241181">What about my blueprints and wares on the station?</t>
 <t id="241182">Sounds fairly straightforward.</t>
 <t id="241183">I'll move my Headquarters.</t>
 <t id="241184">I'll move my Corporation Headquarters.</t>
 <t id="241185">I'll move both the stations.</t>
 <t id="241186">Thanks for the offer, but I'm happy with them where they are.</t>
 <t id="241187">I'm going to have to think about this.</t>
 <t id="241188">OK, I'm ready to pack up the station.</t>
 <t id="241189">Thanks for the offer, but I'm happy with it where it is.</t>
 <t id="241190">I'll be in touch.</t>
 <t id="241191">I need some more information about the Corporation.</t>
 <t id="241192">Thanks for the help.</t>
 <t id="241193">What exactly do you need me to do?</t>
 <t id="241194">I'm here about the shares... Again.</t>
 <t id="241195">It was an accident. Honest, I warned them not to play with the switches...</t>
 <t id="241196">So do you have another job for me?</t>
 <t id="241197">Ooh, I like parties...</t>
 <t id="241198">I think so, what exactly is it you need?</t>
 <t id="241199">Wow!! That's going to be some party.</t>
 <t id="241200">Yes, I think I can manage that.</t>
 <t id="241201">Any suggestions?</t>
 <t id="241202">So where am I going for these Hacker Chips and stuff?</t>
 <t id="241203">OK, I'll be back soon.</t>
 <t id="241204">I've come to collect some Cartography Chips.</t>
 <t id="241205">I don't suppose you have any Hacker Chips as well?</t>
 <t id="241206">Understood.</t>
 <t id="241207">Hi, I'm looking to acquire some Hacker Chips, and I'm told you're the person to talk to.</t>
 <t id="241208">Sorry, can't remember, it was in a bar on a Pirate Base, after a long night of drinking....</t>
 <t id="241209">Were they paranoid? Not especially... Oh Paranid. Sorry, still a little fuzzy. Don't think so, only had two eyes, or were they mouths..?\nCan you help me?</t>
 <t id="241210">Deal, just ask them to keep the noise down when they're loading.</t>
 <t id="241211">{param@Connect1A} - {param@Connect1B}</t>
 <t id="241212">{param@Connect2A} - {param@Connect2B}</t>
 <t id="241213">{param@Connect3A} - {param@Connect3B}</t>
 <t id="242000">Ah yes, they seem to have got themselves in a right old mess there.</t>
 <t id="242001">There is usually something that can be done, it all depends how much effort you are prepared to put in, and how much of a risk you are willing to take.</t>
 <t id="242002">That's how it stands at the moment.</t>
 <t id="242003">True, but not a major problem, Corporate Accounts can assist with a loan to the struggling Corporation.\nI'd be more concerned by the Corporation's poor reputation, and the very low number of shares the owner has in their possession.</t>
 <t id="242004">Basically, the better the Corporation's reputation, the more likely other companies will do business with them. Often you will find that companies will pay more for the same service from a Corporation with a decent reputation, as it gives them some assurance that their needs will be met.</t>
 <t id="242005">Oh various ways. In the day to day running there are always decisions to be made about something or other, in some cases there could be two or more ways to achieve the same overall result. One solution to a particular problem may involve more money to set up, or have lower profit margins in the long run, but could benefit another company or the business community in general, which is good for the Corporation's reputation.</t>
 <t id="242006">In a nutshell, yes. Though sometimes it's not always possible to choose a solution that will be best for the reputation. As you have to consider the amount of money available to set things up, and try keeping your incoming money greater than that going out... Also you may find that whilst a solution may benefit one company, it may not be so good for another, so a third solution that benefits neither could be best in the long run.</t>
 <t id="242007">The more shares that are in a Corporation owner's possession, the more stable the Corporation is. As a general rule, the owner should hold over 50% of the shares as this gives them overall control, they also need to hold a minimum of 60% if they wish to sell the Corporation.</t>
 <t id="242008">No, if one of the other shareholders acquired more shares than the owner, they could effectively gain control of the Corporation. There have been cases in the past where a respectable Corporation became a front for Pirates due to them having the highest shareholding.</t>
 <t id="242009">There are usually records of the original sale, but sometimes shares will pass from one person to another for some reason. It is possible for us to trace the current owner, but may take some time in some cases.</t>
 <t id="242010">Yes, the good news is that whilst the Corporation is in such a poor state, some shareholders will take what they can get for them, whether it's money, goods or services.\nAs the Corporation increases its reputation and value, some may not be as easily persuaded to part with them.</t>
 <t id="242011">Only one more thing I can think of, and that is as the official insolvency agent for the Corporation, you are entitled to 30% of any shares recovered, which could give you a decent shareholding within the Corporation.</t>
 <t id="242012">Exactly, there is also one other thing that may interest you, the previous owner before he passed away ordered and paid for a Corporation Headquarters. Licenses to own these are very rarely granted, and can only pass into possession of the Corporation owner at the time they are built. I am fairly sure the current owner is unaware of this, they have certainly never asked about it.</t>
 <t id="242013">It's certainly something you may wish to think about.</t>
 <t id="242018">I'd probably do the same thing. When you've made your decision, just dock at any Stock Exchange, and the Corporate Accountant there will sort things out for you.</t>
 <t id="242020">Bringing them up now.</t>
 <t id="242021">Anything else I can help with?</t>
 <t id="242022">No Problem, just come and talk to us again if you need further assistance.</t>
 <t id="242023">Certainly, Corporate Accounts has the facility to lend funds in cases like this, with the current owners business record the risk was too great for us.\nHowever if someone with a good business sense, such a yourself were to step in and agree to help, then the risk goes down and we'd help financially.</t>
 <t id="242024">We monitor the situation closely, and if we don't see an improvement we simply pull the plug, sell off the assets and leave the owner at the nearest station with the clothes on their back. To be honest though the way things are at the moment, I doubt they'd even be given the ride to a station...</t>
 <t id="242025">Yes, we've been monitoring their situation closely, and despite you managing to recover the shares and turn round the Corporations reputation, it is still financially unstable.</t>
 <t id="242026">Unfortunately it means we are going to have to pull the plug on it, whilst there is still a chance for us to recover the money we invested.</t>
 <t id="242027">In order to wrap things properly up we need to have all the Corporation shares, I believe you're in possession of a number of these.\nThere is also the Corporation HQ that was ordered but never collected.</t>
 <t id="242028">Normal practice is to sell assets at 2/3 of market value, we would also credit you with the value of the shares you own based on the price they were frozen at when trading stopped.</t>
 <t id="242029">So, are you interested?</t>
 <t id="242030">I'll send you details of where it can be collected from.</t>
 <t id="242031">Let us know what you decide.</t>
 <t id="242032">Yes, as you may know, we recently acquired this Corporation.</t>
 <t id="242033">I can't comment on that. We just saw an opportunity and took it I'm sure you understand.</t>
 <t id="242034">One of the assets we acquired in the takeover was a Corporation Headquarters, we have no use for it and were hoping to do some sort of deal with you in exchange for the shares you still hold.</t>
 <t id="242035">Ah yes, I was told to expect you. The first thing you need to do is to choose the final styling for the station.</t>
 <t id="242036">So, which do you want?</t>
 <t id="242037">An excellent choice. I'll let you know when it's ready for collection.</t>
 <t id="242038">No problem, just let me know when you've made a decision.</t>
 <t id="242039">Hello {player.name},\n\nYour Corporation Headquarters is now ready for collection.\n\nPlease dock at the {object.name@L2M024.EndShipyard} in {object.sector.name@L2M024.EndShipyard} in a TL class ship, with at least 10,500 units of cargo space free.\n\n[center][select value='Accept']   OK   [/select][/center]</t>

I have a proposition I would like to put to you. If you're interested you can contact me at the {object.name@L2M024.ContactStation} in {object.sector.name@L2M024.ContactStation}.\n\n[center][select value='Accept']   OK   [/select][/center]</t>
 <t id="242051">Yes I did, if I could start by explaining my situation.</t>
 <t id="242052">I inherited the Corporation when my uncle passed away, I thought it would be an excellent business opportunity and give me some direction in life.\nUnfortunately I didn't inherit my uncles business sense, and have got myself in a bit of trouble.</t>
 <t id="242053">The bottom line is the business is on the verge of bankruptcy.</t>
 <t id="242054">I was never in possession of all the shares, as my Uncle had either sold or given them away prior to his death.\nThe ones I inherited I have already sold as many as I can, being bound by law to hold ten percent of the shares.</t>
 <t id="242055">The way things are at the moment bankruptcy is fairly certain. If I do nothing and the receivers are called in then I will lose everything. However there is a way that I can hand the running of it over to an intermediary, with the hope of turning things around so at least I have a small chance of walking away with something.</t>
 <t id="242056">Yes, if you agree to it. You seem to have a much better head for business than me, and maybe we can restore the Corporation to what it once was.</t>
 <t id="242057">Of course, I am a little unsure myself. You would need to speak to a Corporate Accountant, they'll be able to explain it to you, and sort out the necessary paperwork if you decide to help me.</t>
 <t id="242058">If you dock at any Stock Exchange, you should find a Corporate Accountant that will be able to help you.</t>
 <t id="242059">Yes, they contacted me to let me know the loan had been paid into the Corporation's account.</t>
 <t id="242060">I've got word that Frenk Stringer has got some problems, and, as it happens he has a number of the Corporations shares. Maybe if you could help him, he might be willing to exchange his shares in return for your assistance.</t>
 <t id="242061">Once again I must thank for your assistance.</t>
 <t id="242062">Hello {player.name},\n\nI am led to believe that you recently discovered a new sector.\n\nThere is a service I can provide to move your Headquarters to a new location. You will find me on {object.name@L2M024.PlayerHQ} in {object.sector.name@L2M024.PlayerHQ} if you're interested.\n\n[center][select value='Accept']   OK   [/select][/center]</t>
 <t id="242063">I'm offering you the chance to pack this station back into a TL so you can relocate it if you wish.</t>
 <t id="242064">I'm offering you the chance to pack this station and your Corporation HQ back into a TL so you can relocate them if you wish.</t>
 <t id="242065">They'll be moved with the station, you don't need to worry about that.\nYou should however make sure any reverse engineering, ship building, repairs or scrapping are completed before we start. Oh and undock any ships, the repacking tends to make a mess of them.</t>
 <t id="242066">So what do you want to do?</t>
 <t id="242067">When you're ready, just park a TL in this sector and give me a shout. I'll take it from there.</t>
 <t id="242068">No problem.</t>
 <t id="242069">I'll head over to your Corporation HQ. When you're ready, just park a TL within 10km of the station and give me a shout. I'll take it from there.</t>
 <t id="242070">OK, stand back and let me get to work.</t>
 <t id="242071">I couldn't find a suitable ship in the sector to pack the station in.</t>
 <t id="242072">Your TL doesn't have enough space to get the station in, you need at least {value@L2M024.HQSpaceNeeded} units of free space.</t>
 <t id="242073">You still have ships docked at the station. Please move them to a safe distance.</t>
 <t id="242074">That was close, I realised at the last moment there was some money on the station, I have transferred {value.formatted@L2M024.StationCredits} to your account for safe keeping.</t>
 <t id="242075">Well I think I'm done here, see you around.</t>
 <t id="242076">OK, that's the first one packed, I'm heading over to your {object.name@L2M024.PlayerHQCorp} in {object.sector.name@L2M024.PlayerHQCorp}. Contact me there when you're ready to pack that one up.</t>
 <t id="242200">Ah yes, poor old Molo Do, always chasing some rumour. I told him that it would get him killed one day.</t>
 <t id="242201">Yes, I'll have it uploaded to your ship's computer. If you choose to continue their work, make sure you don't share their fate.</t>
 <t id="242202">What sort of a problem are we talking about?</t>
 <t id="242203">I assume you've tried the usual methods, mobile drilling lasers, missiles etc...</t>
 <t id="242204">There is one method we have used in cases such as this quite effectively. We use an old freighter, fit it with a remote detonator, pack it with explosives, park it close to the asteroid and blow it up.</t>
 <t id="242205">Hasn't failed us yet.</t>
 <t id="242206">Sure, you dock a freighter here, and pay the 75,000 Credits it costs to have it fitted and we'll sort it for you.</t>
 <t id="242207">All sorted, you will need to put some mines in the cargo bay as explosives. We always use a minimum of twenty, just to be sure. When it's ready, park it as close to the asteroid as you can, but no more than 5km away, then get yourself to a safe distance.</t>
 <t id="242208">Just need to take your payment, and I'll turn control of the ship back over to you.</t>
 <t id="242209">Hello {player.name}, I work for the Gate Research Department based at the {object.name@L2M024.ResearchStation} in {object.sector.name@L2M024.ResearchStation}. My sensors have just picked up a huge spike in the type of energy associated with the gates, this leads me to believe that there may be more gates there now than there were earlier in Heretic's End, where the event was recorded.\n\nThe data collected also puts your ship as the closest thing to the source of the energy spike. I shall probably need you to answer some questions, and will be in touch.\n\n[center][select value='Accept']   OK   [/select][/center]</t>
 <t id="242210">Hello Pilot, I recently contacted you regarding the energy spikes we detected in Heretic's End. I have confirmed that there is indeed one more gate there than there should be.\nThere are questions that need to be answered regarding this, and I'm hoping you may be able to help. Please contact me at {object.name@L2M024.ResearchStation} in {object.sector.name@L2M024.ResearchStation} at your earliest conveniance.\n\n{actor.name@L2M024.GateActor}.\n\n[center][select value='Accept']   OK   [/select][/center]</t>
 <t id="242211">Yes, you were the closest person to the new gate when it appeared in Heretic's End, how come you were there?</t>
 <t id="242212">So how did you know where to look?</t>
 <t id="242213">Most unfortunate indeed.\nInside an asteroid you say? Remarkable, but it is a fully working gate?</t>
 <t id="242214">What we need is another gate to try and connect it to.</t>
 <t id="242215">Yes, unfortunately those gates, and other similar ones in the connected Universe have long been picked over for anything useful, and are totally beyond repair, we've already considered that idea.\nNo, we're going to have to look outside the connected Universe!</t>
 <t id="242216">I believe you're in possession of an Unfocused Jump Drive? From what I gather, this takes you to sectors 'off the grid' so to speak, which should give us the best chance to find a repairable gate.</t>
 <t id="242217">It will have to be a TL class ship, but I believe I can get hold of some new compression technology being developed here, that will help, even then it will probably take up 25,000 units of cargo space.\nPick me up in TL class ship, and we'll give it a try. This is one trip I don't want to miss out on.</t>
 <t id="242218">Molo Do? He worked here for a while, bit of an eccentric, had some fairly wild ideas about the gates if I recall.</t>
 <t id="242219">The Terrans managed to build a working gate some time ago, but with the war going on I don't think they will be willing to help us. We may have to look at trying to repair a broken gate.</t>
 <t id="242220">Molo Do? That wouldn't be the Boron our patrols caught nosing around the gate we built, and chased out of our sectors would it?</t>
 <t id="242221">We managed to build a working gate some time ago, but with most of available resources being diverted to the war effort, building another is out of the question. We may have to look at trying to repair a broken gate.</t>
 <t id="242222">We're going to have to make some space if we have a hope of getting the gate on board, we need to at least 25,000 units of cargo space to fit it in.</t>
 <t id="242223">Great work pilot, I'll get to work and see if this gate is salvageable. I'll be in touch when I know more.</t>
 <t id="242224">Hello {player.name}, I've had a good look at the gate we recovered, and believe we will be able to repair it. There are a few things I'm going to need, if you could stop by the {object.name@L2M024.ResearchStation} in {object.sector.name@L2M024.ResearchStation} I'll let you know what we need.\n\n[center][select value='Accept']   OK   [/select][/center]</t>
 <t id="242225">Yes, just a few things.</t>
 <t id="242226">That's all I can think of for the moment.</t>
 <t id="242227">Not quite, there is something else, but I fear this will be a little more difficult.</t>
 <t id="242228">Black Crystals...</t>
 <t id="242229">I'm not surprised, they aren't widely used anymore.</t>
 <t id="242230">The only ones I've heard of recently are being hauled by Pirates posing as Salvage Crews, running from Maelstrom down to Gain Star.</t>
 <t id="242231">Doubtful, I fear you may have to resort to other methods to acquire them...</t>
 <t id="242232">Excellent work Pilot. These are just what I need; it shouldn't take too much longer now. I'll let you know when it's ready.</t>
 <t id="242233">Hello {player.name}, I have managed to fix the gate, and were ready to deploy it. Come by the {object.name@L2M024.ResearchStation} and I'll fill you in on the plan.\n\n[center][select value='Accept']   OK   [/select][/center]</t>
 <t id="242234">This is just amazing, a previously undiscovered sector, not what I was expecting at all.\nI need to get back to the {object.name@L2M024.ResearchStation} and let my colleagues know what we've found.\n\n[center][select value='Accept']   OK   [/select][/center]</t>
 <t id="242235">Thank you Pilot, there are very few people that are lucky enough to be present when a new sector is discovered. Also the data I managed to collect will aid us in further research of the gates.</t>
 <t id="242236">Yes, we've got it loaded on a Science Ship ready to go.</t>
 <t id="242237">We're going to put it in Void of Opportunity...</t>
 <t id="242239">It is, but our calculations put the best chance of it connecting to the gate in Heretic's End is from the North of Void of Opportunity.\nAlso, if successful, the Pirates will act as a buffer zone between the Terrans and the Commonwealth, and give the Argons a staging post to push into Heretic's End on two fronts.</t>
 <t id="242240">It is, but our calculations put the best chance of it connecting to the gate in Heretic's End is from the North of Void of Opportunity.\nAlso, if successful, it will give us a back door into the Commonwealth, which will be useful with the war going on.</t>
 <t id="242241">We have already sent in a scout, who dropped a beacon for us at what we think will be the best location for the gate.\nThey did however report moderate Pirate activity in the sector, and we're anticipating they won't be happy with what we're doing there. We need you to provide protection for the Science Ship until the gate is deployed.</t>
 <t id="242242">There is one possibility, and that's to use the Gate Hub to force a connection, the hub gate's pair will need to connect to a gate as well so hopefully will pick up the other unconnected gate.</t>
 <t id="242243">Possibly... it can't hurt to try. I'd need to check some figures first.\nAnyway, I'm heading back to base as I've got to get this ship back, I'll let you know when I've found a solution.</t>
 <t id="242244">I think so, though we're going to need some Cartography and Hacker Chips for it to have any chance of success.</t>
 <t id="242245">I have some contacts that should be able to help us.</t>
 <t id="242246">If I could trouble you for a ride over to the hub first, I'll start getting things set up over there, and will upload the contact details for the Cartography Chips on route.</t>
 <t id="242247">I think so.... Oh, hang on a minute... that's interesting...</t>
 <t id="242248">Small power surge, nothing to worry about... I hope.\nSorry... What? Interesting? Oh yes, ah, it appears the hub was getting conflicting gate signals. That should do it...\nWhich set of gates do you want to use?</t>
 <t id="242249">That's it... sort of... The gates seem to be working now, but not quite as we expected. Pick me up and we'll go take a look.</t>

 <t id="182037">Call yourself a professional!!  Killing your passengers or selling them into slavery is not a good idea.  This mission is cancelled, and I'd appreciate it if you could drop any remaining passengers off at a station...  Preferably alive.</t>
 <t id="182038">What are you playing at Pilot!!  I know some of the passengers can be a little obnoxious at times, but shoving them out the airlock is not the answer... This mission is cancelled.  If you have any passengers left on board could you drop them at a station and spare them the indignity of a spacewalk...</t>

I've a good mind not to pay you anything, but I suppose I ought to, here's [yellow]{value.formatted@L2M183.FinalReward}[/yellow] credits for the one you managed to keep safe.</t>
 <t id="183031">Excellent work pilot, all {value@L2M183 Offer.1 L0M83 Convoy Total} Ships made it safely to their destinations.  As promised I'm transferring [yellow]{value.formatted@L2M183.FinalReward}[/yellow] credits to your account.</t>
